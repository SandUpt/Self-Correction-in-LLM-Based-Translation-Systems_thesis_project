有时这一风险包括众所周知的政府与企业之间的“旋转门 ” ， 即私人部门高级岗位与高级官员岗位之间的人事互换。,"Sometimes the risk entails the proverbial “revolving door” between government and business, through which personnel glide from senior private-sector jobs to top official posts and back again.","At times, this risk includes the well-known “revolving door” between government and the private sector, in which senior positions in the private sector are filled by former senior officials."
比约恩·隆姆博格，哥本哈根共识中心的主任，是哥本哈根商学院兼职教授，著有《怀疑主义环保分子并请冷静：怀疑主义环保分子之全球变暖指南 》 。,"That our profligate consumption requires five planets is a catchy story, but it is wrong. The planet we have is more than enough.","Bjørn Lomborg, Director of the Copenhagen Consensus Center, is an adjunct professor at the Copenhagen Business School and author of The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World."
2001年，英国足总（英国足球监管机构）启动了为期五年的儿童安全措施评估，但只开展了两年便不了了之，据说是因为一些足总工作人员的抵制。,"The five-year review of child safety measures, launched by the Football Association (the governing body of UK soccer) in 2001, was dropped after just two years, reportedly in response to resistance from some FA staff.","In 2001, the Football Association (FA), England’s football governing body, launched a five-year child-safety review, which lasted only two years, reportedly because of resistance from some FA staff."
如果这种令人不满意的发展再持续15 到 20年，墨西哥就会变成一个像葡萄牙、希腊或波兰这样的下层中产阶级国家。,"Given 15 to 20 more years of this unsatisfactory progress, Mexico will become a lower-middle class country like Portugal, Greece, or Poland.","If this unsatisfactory development continues for another 15-20 years, Mexico will become a lower-middle-income country like Portugal, Greece, or Poland."
不仅如此，真正意义上的技术执政将建立一支有官僚管理经验的健全的公务员队伍，利用大数据来衡量和优化福利政策。,"Moreover, a real technocracy would boast a robust civil service trained in bureaucratic management techniques that use data to measure and optimize welfare.","Moreover, genuine technocratic rule would establish a competent cadre of civil servants with experience in bureaucratic management, using big data to measure and optimize welfare policies."
发自华盛顿 — — 虽然沙特驻美大使阿德尔·朱拜尔在美国宣称挫败的暗杀阴谋中毫发未伤，但如果这一行动的真正目标并不是朱拜尔，而是为了破坏伊朗总统内贾德的外交政策的话，那么策划者的目的或许已经实现了。,"WASHINGTON, DC – Though Saudi Ambassador Adel al-Jubeir is alive and well in Washington, the plot to assassinate him may have succeeded – if its aim was not to kill al-Jubeir, but rather Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s foreign policy.","WASHINGTON, DC – Although Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to the United States, Adel al-Jubeir, survived an alleged assassination plot in the US, the plotters may have achieved their goal if their target was not Jubeir, but rather to undermine Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s diplomatic initiatives."
持续60年的残酷镇压甚至都难以让西藏和新疆认同这一点，这从2008年的西藏人和2009年的维吾尔人爆乱中可以得知。,"Six decades of ruthless repression has failed to win China acceptance even in Tibet and Xinjiang, as the Tibetan and Uighur revolts of 2008 and 2009 attested.","Sixty years of brutal repression have been insufficient to make Tibetans and Uyghurs accept that, as evidenced by the riots in Tibet in 2008 and in Xinjiang in 2009."
不过人们必须担心五大科技企业的统治力、盈利能力和业务覆盖范围是否已经过大，以至于创业公司很难对其发起挑战，最终扼杀了创新。,"Still, one has to worry that the big five tech firms have become so dominant, so profitable, and so encompassing that it has become very difficult for startups to challenge them, thereby stifling innovation.","But one must worry that the dominance, profitability, and reach of the five tech giants are so great that it is difficult for startups to challenge them, ultimately stifling innovation."
这有利于刺激它们自身增长，同时为中国经济创造空间，向生产率和工资 — — 消费的重要决定因素 — — 更高的价值链上游迈进。,"That promises to boost their own growth while creating space for the Chinese economy to move up the value chain, where productivity and wages – important determinants of consumption – are higher.","This helps to stimulate their own growth, while creating space for China’s economy to move up the value chain, toward higher productivity and wages – important determinants of consumption, which accounts for a large share of the economy."
在今年早些时候举行的纽约第14区民主党初选中，民主社会主义人士亚历山大·奥卡西奥·科尔特斯击败了现任众议院议员、在众议院排名第四的民主党人约瑟夫·克劳利。,"In the Democratic primary election for New York’s 14th district earlier this year, democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez trounced incumbent Representative Joseph Crowley, the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House.","In the recent Democratic primary in New York’s 14th Congressional District, the democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defeated Representative Joseph Crowley, the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House."
他的支持是2006年玻利维亚总统埃沃·莫拉莱斯当选的决定因素，虽然引发了激烈的争论，但在其后的一年里他又支持了尼加拉瓜的丹尼尔·奥尔特加和厄瓜多尔的拉斐尔·科雷亚。,"His backing was a decisive influence in the election of Bolivia’s President Evo Morales in 2006, and the following year he supported Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua and Rafael Correa in Ecuador, though his impact on their victories is hotly debated.","His support was a decisive factor in the election of Evo Morales as President of Bolivia in 2006, though it was controversial, and he backed Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua and Rafael Correa in Ecuador in the following year."
比方说非洲和印度乡下都有不少自行车维修点、报摊和小商店，可以对店主进行培训，让他们学会安装并维护这些系统。,"For example, bicycle mechanics, who are plentiful in Africa and rural India, or small shop and kiosk owners could be trained to install and maintain these systems.","For example, there are many bicycle repair shops, stalls, and small stores in rural Africa and India that could be trained to install and maintain these systems."
里德在谈到史蒂夫·努钦（Steve Mnuchin ） — —前高盛执行副总裁 — — 就任财政部长的合适性时正是持有这一观点：,Reed made precisely this point in speaking to the suitability of Steve Mnuchin – a former Goldman Sachs executive vice president – as Treasury Secretary:,"When discussing the suitability of Steve Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive, for the position of Treasury secretary, he held this view:"
此外，人均欧盟生产率 — — 在1995年之前的20年中，欧洲的这一指标一直在向美国靠拢，到1995年时只比美国低5 % — —在欧元区危机前的十年中相对美国下降了10个百分点。,"Furthermore, per capita EU productivity, which had been converging on the US level for 20 years up to 1995, when Europe was only about 5% below the US, lost ten percentage points in relative terms in the decade preceding the eurozone crisis.","Moreover, per capita EU productivity – which, for 20 years prior to 1995, had been catching up to the US, and was only 5% lower in 1995 – fell by 10 percentage points relative to the US in the eurozone crisis’s first decade."
法德首脑11月中旬在法国多维尔提出倡议修订《里斯本条约 》 ， 把出台强制债务重组机制的时间定在2013年以后，也是为了避免短期内爆发减记潮所可能造成的冲击。,"The Franco-German initiative unveiled at Deauville in early November, which would require some possible measure of restructuring for debt issued after 2013, tried to avoid the immediate shock of a haircut.",French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s proposal in mid-November to revise the Lisbon Treaty to postpone until after 2013 the introduction of a compulsory debt-restructuring mechanism was also motivated by a desire to avoid short-term shocks.
而从前的敌人并没有被惩罚，而是被教育 — — 通过大量美国资金补助的文化和政治项目 — — 变得更像是美国人。,"And, instead of being punished, the former enemies were educated – through cultural and political programs, richly subsidized by US money – to be more like Americans.","Former enemies were not punished, but educated – through cultural and political projects funded by large amounts of US money – to become more like Americans."
囿于现金的朝鲜可能向出价最高者兜售核武器，买家可能是恐怖组织，也可能是同样认为自己需要这一终极武器的国家。,"A cash-strapped North Korea might be tempted to sell nuclear arms to the highest bidder, be it a terrorist group or some country that decided that it, too, needed the ultimate weapon.","Cash-strapped North Korea may sell its nuclear weapons to the highest bidder, which could be a terrorist group or another country that believes it needs the ultimate weapon."
如果他们失败 — — 如我们已经看到的 — — 那么其他人就会趁虚而入，可能打着救世主的未来的旗号行残暴之实。,"If they fail, as we have seen, others will fill the void, potentially with a call for mayhem in the name of messianic futurity.","If they fail – as we have already seen – others will step in, possibly with even worse consequences."
其他小型经济体（主要是欧盟的新成员，它们有很大的经常账户赤字）面临着资本流入突然逆转的风险；这可能已经在拉脱维亚，爱沙尼亚，冰岛以及新西兰发生。,"Other smaller economies (mostly the new members of the EU, which all have large current-account deficits) risk a sudden reversal of capital inflows; this may already be occurring in Latvia and Estonia, as well as in Iceland and New Zealand.","Other small economies (principally the EU’s new members, which have large current-account deficits) face the risk of a sudden reversal of capital inflows; this has already occurred in Latvia, Estonia, Iceland, and New Zealand."
中国需要用上述结构性改革带来的改革红利，包括市场活力和整体经济稳定性增长，来抵消GDP增速放缓的改革成本。,The deceleration in GDP growth that such reforms would cause would be more than offset by increased market dynamism and overall economic stability.,"China needs the reform dividends, including market dynamism and overall economic stability, that structural reforms can bring to offset the cost of slower GDP growth."
现在，美国不应该重复“这与伊斯兰教无关”之类的老生常谈，而应该承认美国已经成为激进伊斯兰与开明伊斯兰和法治之间的战斗的新战场。,"Instead of repeating like a broken record that “this has nothing to do with Islam,” it is time to admit that the US has become yet another theater in the battle between the Islam of the radicals and the Islam of enlightenment and the rule of law.","Rather than repeating the “this has nothing to do with Islam” mantra, the US should recognize that it has become a new battleground in the fight between radical and moderate Islam and the rule of law."
肯尼迪言简意赅地给出了对问题的判断 ： “ 我们都陷入到危险的恶性循环之中，一方的怀疑引起对方的怀疑，新武器很快招来反制武装 。 ”,"Kennedy diagnosed the problem succinctly: “We are both caught up in a vicious and dangerous cycle in which suspicion on one side breeds suspicion on the other, and new weapons beget counter-weapons.”","John F. Kennedy distilled the judgment succinctly: “We are caught in a vicious circle of suspicion and counter-suspicion, of new weapons and counter-weapons.”"
但他们也密切跟进美国的政治，而在这些天来，许多人认为，领导层飘忽不定的风险已不再是金氏王朝所独有的现象。,"But they also follow American politics closely, and these days, many regard the dangers of erratic leadership as no longer being confined to Kim’s regime.","But they are also closely attuned to US politics, and, in recent days, many have argued that the risk of a leadership vacuum is no longer unique to the Kim dynasty."
中国的高层人士很快从国际经验中认识到应对企业债务问题将会限制短期经济增长和增加社会成本 — — 例如失业。,"Influential voices in China are quick to draw the lesson from international experience that tackling corporate debt can limit short-term growth and impose social costs, such as unemployment.","China’s policymakers soon learned from international experience that addressing corporate debt would limit short-term economic growth and increase social costs, such as unemployment."
如果对增加消费的新一轮强调能使中国储蓄相对GDP的比率下降5 % ， 那么中国依然会是全球储蓄率最高的国家，但这5%的下降将完全消灭中国的经常账户盈余。,"If the new emphasis on increased consumption shrank China’s saving rate by 5% of its GDP, it would still have the world’s highest saving rate. But a five-percentage-point fall would completely eliminate China’s current-account surplus.","If a renewed emphasis on increasing consumption were to reduce China’s saving relative to GDP by 5%, the country would still have the highest saving rate in the world, but its current-account surplus would be eliminated."
土耳其对伊拉克北部地区实施的有限的军事打击除开会使伊拉克当局作出公开谴责和口头宣称伊拉克的主权外，不会再引起其他反应。,A limited Turkish strike into northern Iraq would probably elicit little reaction beyond public condemnation and rhetorical assertions of Iraqi sovereignty.,"Turkey’s limited military strikes in northern Iraq would not elicit any other response from the Iraqi authorities, except for public denunciations and verbal declarations of Iraq’s sovereignty."
阿以冲突一个令人伤心的不断发生的状况就是受到羞辱的阿拉伯一方并没有因为任何一次战争的失败而达成和平协议，正如以色列所取得的任何压倒性胜利并没有使它的领导表现出胜利者的大度。,"It has been a sadly recurrent condition of the Arab-Israeli conflict that no war lost by a humiliated Arab side has ever ushered in a peace settlement, just as no war overwhelmingly won by Israel has ever led its leaders to be magnanimous in victory.","The tragic recurring pattern in the Arab-Israeli conflict is that the humiliated Arab side does not make peace after any defeat in war, just as Israel’s leaders do not show magnanimity after any overwhelming victory."
小学和中学的努力有助于在女生中培养更多样化的兴趣，让有才华的年轻女性获得她们所需要的工具，在关键经济部门做出重要贡献。,"Efforts by primary and secondary schools could help to foster more diverse interests among female students, giving talented young women the tools they need to make important contributions to key economic sectors.","Efforts in primary and secondary schools help to foster more diverse interests among girls, giving talented young women the tools they need to make important contributions in key economic sectors."
在这一背景下，必须指出，尽管金正恩的和平提议是出于渴望重建饱受制裁摧残的朝鲜经济的动机，但改变一个惯于忍受极端艰难时期的国家的行为绝非仅靠制裁。,"In this context, it is important to note that, while Kim’s peace overtures are motivated by a desire to rebuild North Korea’s sanctions-battered economy, sanctions alone did not change the behavior of a country long used to enduring extreme hardship.","Against this backdrop, it must be noted that, while Kim’s peace proposal was motivated by a desire to revive the devastated North Korean economy, changing a country’s behavior is not just a matter of imposing sanctions."
"但那些刚刚遭遇房价泡沫爆破的国家则不太会产生另一场房价泡沫,因为趋向保守的政府政策可能会减少对住房的补贴，而这些国家当前的市场气氛似乎也无法催生泡沫。","But another housing bubble is not imminent in countries where one just burst. Conservative government policies will probably reduce subsidies to housing, and the current mood in these markets does not seem conducive to a bubble.","But countries that have just experienced a housing bust are unlikely to experience another one, because conservative government policies are likely to reduce subsidies to housing, and the current market climate does not seem conducive to a bubble."
与NCD有关的大部分健康问题 — — 慢性病痛、睡眠不规律、压抑、残疾和过早死亡 — — 大多与晚期或复杂病症，而不是早期和非复杂病症有关。,"Most health problems linked to NCDs – problems such as chronic pain, disordered sleep, depression, disability, and premature death – are associated with late-stage or complicated disease, rather than with early-stage or uncomplicated disease.","Most of the health problems associated with NCDs – chronic pain, insomnia, depression, disability, and premature death – are associated with late-stage or complex diseases, not early-stage or simple ones."
举例来说，斯堪的那维亚国家、地中海国家以及像爱尔兰和英国那样的“自由的大西洋国家”之间的差别在某些时候要比欧洲整体和美国之间的差别还要大。,"The differences for instance between the Scandinavian countries, the Mediterranean countries, and the “liberal Atlantic countries” like Ireland and the UK are sometimes more pronounced than those between Europe as a whole and the US.","For example, the differences between the Scandinavian countries, the Mediterranean countries, and the “liberal Atlantic countries” like Ireland and the United Kingdom are sometimes greater than the differences between Europe as a whole and the United States."
对于在今年保持发达经济体增长来说，这已经足够；不幸的是，对于发达经济体人民 — — 以及全球经济 — — 所急需的更快的增长来说，这还不够。,"That will be enough to keep the advanced economies growing this year; unfortunately, it will not be enough to attain the faster growth that their citizens’ wellbeing – and that of the global economy – urgently requires.","For this year’s advanced-economy growth, that is enough; unfortunately, it is not enough for the faster growth that people in advanced economies – and the global economy – desperately need."
例如，当我们说美国的生活方式需要五个地球的时候，我们假设技术发展是停滞不前的，然而，全世界范围内的土地使用效率很可能将会大大提高。,"For example, when we talk about American lifestyles needing five planets, we assume that technology is frozen, whereas it is likely that worldwide land-use productivity will increase dramatically.","For example, when we say that America’s lifestyle requires five Earths, we assume that technological progress is stagnant, whereas the worldwide efficiency of land use is likely to increase dramatically."
2010到2025年近半数的全球GDP增长将来自440个新兴市场城市，其中不少西方高管甚至可能都从未听说。,"Nearly half of global GDP growth from 2010 to 2025 will come from 440 emerging-market cities, many of which Western executives may not even know exist.",Nearly half of global GDP growth between 2010 and 2025 will come from 440 emerging-market cities that few Western executives have ever heard of.
“民主”一词来自古希腊语，你也可以在希腊哲学中找到民主思想的核心要素，但这一事实并不意味着民主只存在于西方政治DNA中。,"The fact that the word “democracy” derives from ancient Greek, and that one can discern the kernel of democratic thought in Greek philosophy, by no means implies that democracy is embedded in the West’s political DNA.","“Democracy” is a Greek word, and you can find the core elements of democratic thought in Greek philosophy, but that does not mean that democracy exists only in the DNA of Western politics."
美国国会肯定是一无所知的；其成员仍然忙于为政府支持的住房抵押贷款机构 — — 房利美和房地美 — — 四处游说，从而把危机推向更深处。,"Certainly the US Congress was clueless; its members were still busy lobbying for the government-backed housing-mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, thereby digging the hole deeper.","The US Congress is clueless; its members are still busy lobbying on behalf of the government-backed mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, pushing the crisis deeper."
但旧体系已不再能够提供有用的答案，俄罗斯通过无视联合国安理会（基于国家的国际制度的最高形式）关于乌克兰问题的决议以及在安理会叙利亚决议上从中作梗证明了这一点。,"Yet the old systems no longer offer useful answers, as Russia has demonstrated by brushing aside the United Nations Security Council – the high altar of the state-based international system – over Ukraine and stalemating it over Syria.","But the old system is no longer able to provide useful answers, as Russia has demonstrated by ignoring UN Security Council resolutions (the highest form of international legitimacy) on Ukraine and undermining the Council’s Syria resolution."
日本净债务相当于GDP的130%左右 — — 比任何其他发达经济体都要高得多 — — 目前被迫将很大一部分政府支出用于维持负债。,With net debt of around 130% of GDP – much higher than in other advanced economies – the country is currently forced to allocate a large share of government expenditure toward servicing its liabilities.,Japan’s net debt stands at around 130% of GDP – far higher than in any other advanced economy – and the government is currently forced to spend a large share of its revenues servicing the debt.
值得注意的是，一国债务管理实践的质量与其债务困境风险之间存在强烈的负相关关系，90%的低风险国家都表现出良好的实践水平。,"It is worth noting the strong negative correlation between the quality of a country’s debt-management practices and its risk of debt distress, with 90% of low-risk countries demonstrating good practices.","Notably, the quality of a country’s debt-management practice is negatively correlated with its risk of debt distress, with 90% of low-risk countries exhibiting good practices."
但最近，伦敦经济学院的约翰·范·里宁（John Van Reenen）指出，英国退出的经济理由在行动中难觅踪影。,"But lately, as John Van Reenen of the London School of Economics recently put it, the economic case for Brexit has been largely missing in action.","But, as John Van Reenen of the London School of Economics recently pointed out, the economic case for the UK’s exit is hard to find in action."
如果希腊政府当时没有进行这一调整，国内需求和就业率当然也会维持高位 — — 但进口和庞大的外部赤字也会不断上升。,"If the Greek government had not made such an adjustment, domestic demand and employment would certainly have remained higher – but so would imports and large external deficits.","Had the Greek government not adjusted, domestic demand and employment would have remained high – but imports and the external deficit would have continued to rise."
部分归因于政府的刺激政策，自2008年以来中国增长更多地是由投资而不是消费推动的，这阻碍了世界急需的需求再平衡的进展。,"Partly owing to government stimulus measures, China’s growth since 2008 has been driven more by investment than by consumption, which has impeded the economy’s much-needed demand rebalancing.","Partly owing to the government’s stimulus policies, growth in China since 2008 has been driven more by investment than by consumption, impeding the needed rebalancing of the world economy."
比如，欧元区需要真正的银行联盟（不仅要有共同监督，也要有共同存款保险和共同清算机制）和欧元债券（或类似的债务共同化机制 ） 。,"For example, the monetary union needs a real banking union – including not just common supervision, but also common deposit insurance and a common resolution mechanism – and Eurobonds, or some similar vehicle for mutualizing debt.","For example, the eurozone needs a genuine banking union (not just common supervision, but also common deposit insurance and common resolution mechanisms), and eurobonds (or similar debt-consolidation mechanisms)."
更重要的是，美国公司并非如同特朗普和国会共和党所声称的那样，是因为税率太高而囤积了数万亿美元现金而拒绝进行资本投资。,"More to the point, US corporations aren’t hoarding trillions of dollars in cash and refusing to make capital investments because the tax rate is too high, as Trump and congressional Republicans claim.","More important, US companies are not hoarding trillions of dollars in cash, as Trump and congressional Republicans claim, because tax rates are too high."
如果任由目前的趋势继续下去，世界多数现存的生物物种将在本世纪末灭绝，而造成这种局面的虽然也有其他因素，但最主要的还是粮食产量。,"If current trends continue, the majority of the world’s remaining species will be extinct by the end of the century, and it is food production, above all other factors, that has driven the decline.","If current trends continue, the majority of the world’s existing species will be extinct by the end of this century, and the main cause is food production."
自从 2008 年 9 月雷曼兄弟倒闭以来，欧盟和欧元势必受冲击的事实已经变得很清楚，因为欧洲缺乏统一的政府和财政政策。,"Ever since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, it has been clear that the global crisis would challenge the EU and the euro, because Europe lacks a common government and fiscal policy.","Since Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008, it has become clear that the EU and the euro are vulnerable, owing to Europe’s lack of a unified government and fiscal policy."
马歇尔计划是一套宏观经济战略，包括大规模资本转移以帮助制度发展良好的国家重建被战争摧毁的工业产能和基础设施。,The Marshall Plan was a macroeconomic strategy involving massive capital transfers to help reconstruct the war-ravaged industrial capacity and infrastructure of economies with well-developed institutions.,The Marshall Plan was a macroeconomic strategy that included massive capital transfers to help war-torn countries rebuild their industrial capacity and infrastructure.
这是个危险而动荡的组合，其理论和方法基础曾经导致俄罗斯帝国 — — 不管是沙皇帝国还是苏联帝国 — — 失败和毁灭。,"It is a dangerous and volatile mix, relying on principles and methods that led Russia’s empires – Czarist and Soviet – to failure and ruin.","This is a dangerous and volatile combination, whose theoretical and methodological underpinnings led to the failure and destruction of the Russian empire – whether tsarist or Soviet."
更令人意想不到的是导弹发射成功，朝鲜第十个加盟全球“太空俱乐部 ” （ 2008年伊朗成功发射萨菲尔火箭后第九个加盟 ） 。,"More surprising was the success of the launch, which makes North Korea the tenth member of the world’s “Space Club” (the ninth member was Iran, which successfully launched its Safir rocket in 2008).","More surprisingly, the missile launch succeeded, making North Korea the tenth country to join the global “space club” (after Iran, which successfully launched a Safir rocket in 2008, the ninth)."
在此期间的大多数时候，凭借着货币政策委员会过往在稳定物价方面的杰出表现，英国公众都预期来年的通胀将比当年要低。,"For most of this period, the British public expected inflation in the coming year to be lower than in the previous year, thanks to the MPC’s strong track record on price stability.","During most of this period, the British public expected inflation to be lower in the coming year than it had been the previous year, owing to the Monetary Policy Committee’s sterling record of price stability."
伊斯兰堡—上个月，牛津大学格林坦普顿学院（GTC）在艾格洛夫公园（Egrove Park）召开了一年一度的新兴市场研讨会。,"ISLAMABAD – Last month, Oxford University’s Green Templeton College held its annual Emerging Markets Symposium at Egrove Park.","ISLAMABAD – Last month, the University of Oxford’s Green Templeton College (GTC) held its annual conference on emerging markets in Egrove Park."
拉加德告诉欧洲人，他们的银行需要重组，否则就必须建立防火墙防止金融传染。 忠言逆耳，但欧洲人还是照办了。,The Europeans did not like it much when Lagarde told them their banks needed to be restructured or that they needed to build a firewall to protect against financial contagion – but they did it.,"Lagarde told Europeans that their banks needed to be recapitalized, or else a firewall would have to be erected to prevent financial contagion. The message was unpalatable, but Europe complied."
据詹姆斯·麦迪逊大学宗教研究教授艾伦·莱文诺维茨（Alan Levinovitz）看来，特朗普在推特中使用大写的次数堪与过去几百年中坑蒙拐骗普罗大众的“老军医”和神棍相比。,"According to Alan Levinovitz, a professor of religious studies at James Madison University, Trump uses capitalization in his tweets much as medical quacks and religious charlatans did in their efforts to bamboozle the public in centuries past.","According to Alan Levinovitz, a professor of religious studies at James Madison University, Trump’s use of capital letters in his tweets is reminiscent of the “old snake oil salesmen” and charlatans who conned the public for centuries."
他长期构思的欧洲演讲虽然不乏大家一致认可的观点，但也为长期激烈的争论埋下了伏笔 — — 而且此次争论的范围并不仅限于英国。,"His long-gestating speech on Europe, although containing elements that many might share, also sows the seeds for a prolonged and acrimonious debate – and not just in Britain.","His long-awaited speech on Europe, though widely praised, contained the seeds of a long and bitter debate – not just in the UK."
埃及并没有煽动以色列和哈马斯在加沙地带的交火升级，相反却与美国和其他区域盟国合作敦促双方签订停火协议。,"Rather than inciting an escalation in fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, Egypt worked with the US and other regional allies to broker a cease-fire.","Rather than fueling the escalation of fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, Egypt has been working with the US and other regional allies to broker a ceasefire."
在当时的前现代世界，私人生活令人难以置信地公开化，而十九二十世纪的社会运动极大地拓展了个人隐私和自我定义的领域。,"In that pre-modern world, private life was extraordinarily public, whereas the social movements of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries dramatically expanded the realm of individual privacy and self-definition.","In the pre-modern world, private life was astonishingly public, while the social movements of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries greatly expanded the domain of individual privacy and self-definition."
而这个引发众多争议的提议 — — 其中最著名的倡议者是约翰•凯恩斯（John Maynard Keynes ） — —要求为初级商品建立一个“缓冲库存 ” ， 当价格下跌时吸纳产品，反之则增加供应量。,"This argument inspired proposals – most famously by John Maynard Keynes in 1942 – to create “buffer stocks” for the main commodities, which would take supply off the market when prices fell, and add to supply when prices rose.","The controversial proposal – championed by John Maynard Keynes, among others – called for the creation of a “buffer stock” of primary commodities, which would be withdrawn from the market when prices fell and added to supply when they rose."
随着共产主义的垮台，雅尔塔会议所创造的分裂的欧洲已经不见踪影，而欧盟的扩张也不再局限于属于西方阵营的国家。,"With communism’s collapse, the divided Europe created at Yalta disappeared, and EU expansion was no longer confined to states belonging to the Western orbit.","With the collapse of communism, the division of Europe created at Yalta has disappeared, and the EU has expanded beyond the Western camp."
俄国首位民主总理盖达尔领导的自由俄罗斯选择党在1993年大选中赢得了15.5%的选票，并和盟友一道成为杜马的主要力量。,"The liberal Russia’s Choice party, led by the country’s first democratic prime minister, Yegor Gaidar, received 15.5% of the vote in the 1993 general election, and with its allies formed the largest bloc in the Duma.","The Yabloko party, led by Russia’s first democratically elected prime minister, Yegor Gaidar, won 15.5% of the vote in the 1993 elections and became a major force in the Duma."
该国还在全球能源需求中所占的比例不断扩大，这意味着中国经济向服务和消费主导型增长的持续转型将重塑全球能源行业。,"It also accounts for a growing share of global energy demand, meaning that its economy’s continuing shift toward service- and consumption-led growth will reshape the resource sector worldwide.","Moreover, China’s share of global energy demand is increasing, implying that the country’s ongoing transition to a services- and consumption-led economy will reshape the global energy industry."
第二，欧洲和美国看待彼此的方式之间存在一种持续的结构失衡：欧洲带着热情关注美国，而美国对欧洲兴趣一般，而且越来越不关心。,"Second, there is a continuing structural imbalance between the way Europe looks at America, i.e., with passion and concern, and the way America looks at Europe, i.e., with mild interest giving way to growing indifference.","Second, there is a persistent structural imbalance in the way that Europeans and Americans view each other: Europeans are generally more interested in the US than vice versa, and increasingly less so."
因为其中许多激进在成为财务投资者之前就持有国有企业股份，它们的持仓往往十分多样化，通常包括同样的国有企业以及房地产和上市和非上市公司股份。,"Because many of them held stakes in state-owned enterprises before becoming financial investors, their holdings tend to be diverse, and often include those same SOEs, as well as real estate and equity stakes in listed and unlisted companies.","Because many of them held state-owned shares before becoming financial investors, their portfolios are diverse, often including the same state-owned shares as well as real estate and shares of listed and unlisted companies."
奥巴马应该采取主动，使明年哥本哈根会议不再是讨论为低效的技术提供越来越高的补贴，而是把投资向未来的技术突破倾斜。,"Obama should seize the initiative and make the meeting in Copenhagen next year not about bloated subsidies for inefficient technologies, but about lean investments in future breakthroughs.",Obama should take the initiative and make next year’s Copenhagen meeting a forum for shifting investment away from subsidies for inefficient technologies and toward future technological breakthroughs.
这些结果的任何一个都有悖于中国的战略利益；但和许多政府一样，中国领导人将避免短期的艰难决定，即使这会导致长期的不利结果。,"Any of these outcomes would be inconsistent with Chinese strategic interests; but, like many governments, China’s leaders will seek to avoid difficult decisions in the short run, even if this results in damaging outcomes over time.","Any of these outcomes would run counter to China’s strategic interests; but, like many governments, China’s leaders will avoid short-term painful decisions, even if this leads to long-term adverse outcomes."
近几周来，艾哈迈迪内贾德的助手否定了另一个传闻，即他命令其全体阁员写一份效忠十二世伊玛姆的契约，将其投入圣城库姆附近的一口井中，据称该井为伊玛姆的藏身之所。,"In recent weeks, Ahmadinejad’s aides have denied another rumor that he ordered his cabinet to write a pact of loyalty with the 12th Imam and throw it down a well near the holy city of Qom, where some believe the Imam is hiding.","In recent weeks, Ahmedinejad’s aides have denied another rumor, that he ordered his entire cabinet to sign a pledge of allegiance to the Twelfth Imam and throw it into a well near Qom, supposedly the Imam’s hiding place."
以作为各央行储备货币的国际使用以及作为外汇市场载体的标准看，美元坠落速度最快的阶段是1978—1991年和2001—2010年。,"By the criteria of international use as a reserve currency among central banks and as a vehicle in foreign-exchange markets, the most rapid declines took place from 1978 to 1991 and from 2001 to 2010.","In terms of international use of central banks’ reserves and the dollar’s role as a vehicle in the foreign-exchange market, the fastest decline occurred from 1978 to 1991 and from 2001 to 2010."
同样地，英国保守党领袖卡梅隆所谓从监狱里释放出来的人“最需要的是爱”的说法震动了他的党内更为古派的支持者。,"Likewise, the leader of Britain’s Conservatives, David Cameron, startled more old-fashioned supporters of his party by saying that people released from prison “need, above all, love.”","Likewise, British Conservative Party leader David Cameron’s statement that people released from prison “need love more than anything else” shocked his party’s more traditional supporters."
“重夺控制权”的矛头同时也直指位于卢森堡的欧洲法院，按照欧盟公约规定，其判决的效力超过各国本国法院。,"“Getting back control” was also directed against the EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg, whose judgments, by convention, have precedence over judgments by national courts.","“Reclaiming sovereignty” is also aimed at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, which, according to EU treaties, has the power to overrule national courts."
事实上，尽管就各国究竟在多大程度上吸取了过往教训方面还一直存在着不确定性，更别提各国之间的不一致性，但许多新兴经济体已经在较长时期内构筑了更加健全的基本面。,"Indeed, despite enduring uncertainties over the degree to which they have absorbed the lessons of the past, not to mention inconsistencies across countries, many emerging economies have developed much sounder fundamentals over an extended period.","Indeed, while there is considerable uncertainty about the extent to which countries have learned from the past, and even more about the extent to which they have learned from each other, many emerging economies have built more solid foundations over longer periods."
而信贷渠道同样不甚通畅，因为银行已经囤积了来自量化宽松的大部分额外流动性，不但没有增加贷款，反而还产生了多余的储备。,"The credit channel also is not working properly, as banks have hoarded most of the extra liquidity from QE, creating excess reserves rather than increasing lending.","Credit channels are also not working well, because banks have accumulated most of the additional liquidity provided by quantitative easing, and have not increased lending, but instead have built up excess reserves."
他们发现在这一时期，当国内企业所得税率高于其他经合组织国家时，企业利润增长的平均值就会超过了 GDP 增长。,"They find that, during that period, average corporate-profit growth outpaced GDP growth whenever the domestic corporate-income-tax rate exceeded that of other OECD countries.","They found that, during this period, when the domestic corporate tax rate was higher than in other OECD countries, the average rate of growth of corporate profits exceeded that of GDP."
尽管传统上贸易被认为是决定汇率的主要因素，汇率涨跌通常被认为可以纠正一国的对外贸易失衡，但当今资本跨境流动规模已经非常庞大，它们对汇率的冲击比以前大很多 。,"While trade is supposed to be the primary driver of exchange rates, which should rise or fall to correct countries’ external imbalances, capital flows have grown to the point that their role in guiding exchange rates is now much larger.","Although traditionally trade was seen as the main determinant of exchange rates, exchange-rate fluctuations were thought to correct external imbalances in a country’s trade, but cross-border capital flows are now so large that their impact on exchange rates is much greater."
不，无论我们是否愿意承认，真正的区别是中共政府成功地将其人口中的很大一部分全球化了，远远超过印度民主政府所达到的水平。,"No, the real difference – whether we like to admit it or not – is that China’s communist government has succeeded in globalizing a much larger share of its population than India’s democratic government has managed to do.","No, the real difference is that the Chinese government has successfully globalized a much larger share of its population than India’s democratic government has."
澳大利亚连续数周的降雨更让人们怀疑，所谓的全球变暖，只不过是联合国或那些心怀不轨的科学家，甚至是火星人杜撰出来的大骗局罢了。,A few weeks of rain in Australia has emboldened those who think that global warming is a gigantic hoax perpetrated by the United Nations or conspiring scientists or maybe men from Mars.,"Australia’s weeks-long rainfall has convinced many that global warming is a hoax perpetrated by the United Nations, unscrupulous scientists, or even Martians."
日本政府债（JGBs）总欠债额近乎达到不可思议的9万亿美元，仅略低于欧元区17国欠债总额的10.5万亿美元，而后者的人口数量达到前者的三倍。,"The total outstanding volume of Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) is an almost unfathomable $9 trillion, only just below the $10.5 trillion in outstanding debt for the full 17-country eurozone, which has more than triple the population.","Japan’s government debt (JGBs) totals nearly $9 trillion, almost as much as the $10.5 trillion owed by the eurozone’s 17 countries, whose population is three times larger."
在欧洲，危机的根源来自于一个单一政治联盟的缺位，因为这是分担债务并以此将欧元构筑在一个合理基础之上的必要前提。,"In Europe, the absence of a political union – considered a necessary precondition for sharing debt obligations and, thus, putting the euro on a sound footing – is widely held to lie at the root of the continent’s crisis.","In Europe, the roots of the crisis lie in the absence of a single political union, which is necessary to share the burden of debt and thus to build the euro on a sound foundation."
但作为减小核武器威胁的全球性措施的基础 — — 1968年核不扩散条约（NPT）的签署国，它们也有义务这样做。,"But, as signatories to the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) – the foundation of global efforts to reduce the threat posed by nuclear weapons – they also had an obligation to do so.","But, as the basis for a global effort to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons, they have an obligation to do so."
但面对俄国坚定不移的帝国重振政策 ， （ 现在在高加索也已清晰可见）美国似乎未能察觉全球事态发展的联系因素。,"But, confronted with a resolute Russian policy of imperial re-assertion, now also visible in the Caucasus, the US seems unable to see how global developments are linked.","But, in the face of Russia’s unwavering imperial revanchism (now clearly visible in the Caucasus), the US seems to be oblivious to the links between global developments."
以色列领导人知道哈马斯有中程导弹（主要通过西奈地下渠道走私进入 ） ， 但他们仍然指出，不对加沙进行包围，伊朗和其他国家就会提供更多更先进的武器。,"Israeli leaders were aware of Hamas’s buildup of medium-range missiles, mostly smuggled through Sinai in underground tunnels, but continue to argue that, absent the siege, Iran and others would supply more (and more sophisticated) weapons.","Israeli leaders know that Hamas has medium-range missiles (mainly smuggled through the tunnels under Gaza), but they argue that failing to encircle Gaza would allow Iran and others to provide more advanced weapons."
出资者将所谓的“捐助金内 ” （ in-donor）难民成本记录为ODA所依据的规则是经合组织-DAC统计报告条例在1988年制定的。,The rule enabling donors to report so-called “in-donor” refugee costs as ODA was introduced in the OECD-DAC Statistical Reporting Directives back in 1988.,Donors record the so-called “in-donor” refugee costs as ODA-eligible on the basis of the OECD-DAC statistical reporting rules established in 1988.
尽管法国政府跟西班牙和意大利两国政府有所区别，可以毫无困难地以低利率为自身融资，但在国家经济进入衰退时货币升值就像向未点燃的篝火增加燃料一样。,"Although the French government, unlike its Spanish and Italian counterparts, has not yet had any difficulty financing itself at low interest rates, currency appreciation as the economy slides into recession is like fuel poured onto an unlit bonfire.","While the French government differs from those of Spain and Italy in that it can easily finance itself at low interest rates, currency appreciation in a recession is like pouring gasoline on an unlit fire."
1953年以来，美国一直反对伊朗的自治和经济发展，手段包括各种秘密行动、支持1953—1979年间的极权统治、军事支持伊朗的敌人，以及长达数十年的制裁等。,"Since 1953, the US has opposed Iran’s self-rule and economic development through covert action, support for authoritarian rule during 1953-79, military backing for its enemies, and decades-long sanctions.","Since 1953, the US has opposed Iran’s autonomy and economic development through a variety of covert operations, support for the autocratic regime from 1953 to 1979, military support for Iran’s enemies, and decades of sanctions."
法庭认为，该法律合理的目的是为具有特殊困难的学生作出教学调节，并且，心理测试看上去是足够客观，并未牵涉到种族偏见。,"According to the Court, the law’s legitimate purpose is to adapt teaching to the difficulties of a specific category of pupils, and psychological tests seem to be objective enough not to be suspected of racial bias.","The court reasoned that the law’s legitimate purpose was to adjust teaching to students with special needs, and that the psychological tests seemed objective and not racially biased."
在加拿大，总理贾斯汀·特鲁多（Justin Trudeau）的政府已经宣布了一项计划以增加公共投资。,"In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s administration has announced a plan to boost public investment.","In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has announced a plan to increase public investment."
当然他也必须与伊朗讨价还价，确保伊朗人能信守承诺，并作为一个无核武器国家继续留在《核不扩散条约》之内。,"And, of course, he will need to pursue the negotiations with Iran to persuade them to keep their word and remain in the NPT as a non-nuclear weapon state.","Of course, he must also bargain with Iran to ensure that the Iranians live up to their commitments and remain in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear state."
印度空间研究组织（ISRO）的科学家们自信从这一教训中汲取了宝贵的经验，但Chandrayaan任务的局部失败仍使他们挥之不去的阴影。,"While scientists at the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) believe that they gained valuable lessons from the experience, the partial failure of the Chandrayaan mission still haunts them.","Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) scientists learned valuable lessons from the experience, but the partial failure of the Chandrayaan mission still casts a shadow."
但这正是奥巴马的另一个非同寻常之处：他身份的复杂性使他具有真正的世界性，成为全球化时代的一位全球化候选人。,"But that is another reason why Obama is exceptional: the complexity of his identity makes him truly universal, a global candidate for a global age.",But this is another of Obama’s unusual qualities: his complexity makes him a truly global candidate in an era of globalization.
至少它将为政治家们的行动带来条理性，而那些反对这种欧洲新平衡的探索的人 — — 大部分都是马克思主义者和民粹主义者 — — 将必须找到理由去说服他们自己。,"At the very least, it would bring a sense of coherence to the actions of politicians, and those opposed to this search for a new European equilibrium – mostly Marxists and populists – would need to compete with a new vision of their own.","At the very least, it will provide a rationale for politicians’ actions, and those who oppose this exploration of a new European balance – mostly Marxists and populists – will have to find reasons to convince themselves."
事实上，人类已知最致命的疾病是天花；直到1796年爱德华·詹纳（Edward Jenner）发明了天花疫苗前，它一直是欧洲的第一死亡原因。,"In fact, smallpox is the deadliest disease known to humanity; until Edward Jenner developed the vaccine in 1796, it was the leading cause of death in Europe.","Indeed, the most lethal disease known to humans is smallpox; until Edward Jenner developed a vaccine in 1796, it was the leading cause of death in Europe."
在这方面我们掌握的信息很少，只有从国际并购中了解的有限信息和朝鲜带出材料上探测出的某些高浓缩铀（HEU）痕迹。,"We have scant information about this, beyond some limited information about international acquisitions and some detection of traces of highly enriched uranium (HEU) on materials brought out of North Korea.","On this score, we have little to go on, other than limited information from international acquisitions and traces of highly enriched uranium (HEU) that the North Koreans left behind."
不仅他是如此：在每一个伟大的帝国背后，都有一位伟大的哲学家和历史学家，他的世界观推动帝国带着合法性甚至神圣性前进。,And he was not unique: behind every great empire has been a great philosopher or historian whose worldview imbued the imperial drive with legitimacy and even sacred significance.,"Not only that: in every great empire, there was a great philosopher and historian whose worldview pushed the empire forward with a sense of legitimacy or even sanctity."
面对如此的现实，住在赫尔辛基的公务员Jiri Räsänen刚开始也同样感到沮丧，但随后他和他的朋友们想到了一个好主意：为什么不能在保留汽车的前提下，而只是更换发动机呢？,"That fact at first depressed Jiri Räsänen, a civil servant in Helsinki – but then it gave him and his friends a good idea. Why not keep the cars but replace their engines?","Faced with this reality, Jiri Räsänen, a civil servant in Helsinki, was initially depressed, but then he and his friends came up with a good idea: why not just replace the engine, rather than the whole car?"
在最初的近似（first approximation）中，低碳路径是主要战略，并产生了完全不同也远远更加有利的起作用的激励结构观。,"On a first approximation, low-carbon paths are the dominant strategies, implying a completely different and far more favorable view of the incentive structures at work.","In the first approximation, the low-carbon path is the main strategy, and the incentive structure is radically different and far more favorable."
这意味着官方增长率没有反映与空调、抗癌药物、新手术流程以及其他许多普通创新一起到来的真实收入的提高。,"That means that the official growth rate does not reflect the rise in real incomes that came with air conditioning, anti-cancer drugs, new surgical procedures, and the many more mundane innovations.","This means that the official growth rate does not reflect the real increase in income from air conditioners, cancer drugs, new surgical procedures, and many other ordinary innovations."
如果竞技体育对成绩的狭隘关注限制了我们对冲浪美与和谐的体味，而因此硬要在冲浪时强行加入更多的转向恐怕就太遗憾了。,It would be highly regrettable if the competitive sport’s narrow focus on point-scoring were to limit our appreciation of the beauty and harmony we can experience riding a wave without fitting as many turns as possible into our time on it.,"If the narrow focus on results in competitive sports limits our appreciation of surfing’s beauty and harmony, it’s too bad that we have to add more turns when we surf."
但随着世界各国经济联系日趋紧密，一个全球层面的产权基础设施体系也已经初具规模，并使得建立有效的国家层面的产权基础设施和准确的价格发现机制显得更加重要。,"But, as the world economy has become increasingly interconnected, a global property-rights infrastructure (PRI) has emerged – further raising the stakes of developing effective national PRIs and accurate price-discovery mechanisms.","But, as the world’s economies become increasingly interconnected, a global infrastructure of property rights is emerging, making it more important than ever to establish effective national-level infrastructures of property rights and accurate pricing mechanisms."
示威者动员了整个国家，他们决心要让亚努科维奇信守签署欧盟协议、不让乌克兰加入与俄罗斯的关税联盟的承诺。,"Determined to hold him to his promise to sign the EU agreement and not take Ukraine into a customs union with Russia, the protesters mobilized the country.","The protesters mobilized the entire country, determined to make Yanukovych keep his promise to sign the EU agreement and not to allow Ukraine to join Russia’s customs union."
巴方已经满足了以方以及国际社会提出的所有安全要求，而在两国方案上言而无信的内塔尼亚胡政府却依然不愿划定本方边界。,"Palestinians complied with all Israeli and international requirements for security, while Binyamin Netanyahu’s Israeli government, which gives lip-service to the two-state solution, has yet to elucidate where Israel’s borders will be.","The Palestinians have fulfilled all of Israel’s and the international community’s security requirements, but the Netanyahu government remains unwilling to define the border."
而这在一定程度上还是要归功于这位老独裁者。 由于在其死前恢复了国王胡安▪卡洛斯领导下的君主政治，弗朗哥给西班牙提供了一个重建的基础。,"Here the old dictator can take some credit, for by re-establishing the monarchy under King Juan Carlos just before he died, Franco provided Spain with a foundation on which to build anew.","And this, to some extent, was due to the old dictator himself, who, by restoring the monarchy under King Juan Carlos, provided Spain with a foundation on which to rebuild."
特别是俞正声、张德江和张高丽，他们来自中国最强大、最有活力的三个都市中心 — — 上海、重庆和天津。,"That is especially true of Yu Zhengsheng and the two Zhangs, Dejiang and Gaoli, who come from senior roles in three of China’s most powerful and dynamic urban centers – Shanghai, Chongqing, and Tianjin.","In particular, Yu Zhengsheng, Zhang Dejiang, and Zhang Gaoli hail from China’s three most dynamic urban centers – Shanghai, Chongqing, and Tianjin."
果真如此的话，那么姗姗来迟十年的欧盟新全球外交和安全政策战略（Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy）就是一件大好事。,"If so, then the European Union’s new Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy, more than a decade overdue, must be a very good thing.","If so, it would be a good thing that the EU’s long-delayed Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy has finally been published."
伯南克与在2006年接管美联储，他1999年在同一会议上发表了一篇精彩论文，从而开始了他的决策事业。,"Bernanke, who took over at the Fed in 2006, launched his policy career in 1999 with a brilliant paper presented to the same Jackson Hole conference.","Bernanke, who took over the Fed in 2006, delivered a brilliant paper at the same conference in 1999 that launched his career as a policymaker."
执政后的哈马斯是否会变得务实而且减低从事恐怖主义目前不得而知。 这当然有可能，但是我们不应该提前判断结果。,"It is still an open question whether Hamas in government will become more pragmatic and less committed to terrorism: it certainly is a possibility, and one should not prejudge the outcome.","It is too early to tell whether Hamas, in power, will be pragmatic and reduce its terrorism."
更加多元化的马哈拉施特拉邦的奥兰加巴德（Aurangabad）城市集群是不少印度最大的种子公司的所在地，拥有活跃的汽车、制药和糖生产行业，同时也是旅游枢纽，坐落着阿旃陀（Ajanta）和艾洛拉（Ellora）石窟。,"The more diversified Aurangabad cluster, in Maharashtra, is home to some of India’s largest seed companies, an active automotive, pharmaceutical, and sugar-manufacturing industry, and a tourism hub that includes the Ajanta and Ellora caves.","Aurangabad, a more diverse city cluster in the state of Maharashtra, is home to many of India’s largest seed companies, as well as active automotive, pharmaceutical, and sugar industries, and serves as a tourist hub for the Ajanta and Ellora caves."
诺贝尔经济学奖获得者阿玛蒂亚·森强调：大多数饥荒发生时粮食都并非真的紧缺，而是未能把粮食运到需要的人们手中，这在很大程度上是因为他们缺乏购买力。,"The Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen has emphasized that most famines are associated not with a shortage of food, but the failure to get food to the people who need it, largely because they lack purchasing power.","Amartya Sen, a Nobel laureate in economics, has emphasized that most famines occur when food is not actually scarce, but is not delivered to those who need it, largely because they lack purchasing power."
今年5月，巴拿马当局扣留了一艘载有磷酸盐的驶往加拿大的船只，这艘船上的磷酸盐是由一家国有摩洛哥企业在在西撒哈拉占领区非法开采的。,"This past May, the Panamanian authorities detained a Canada-bound ship carrying phosphates that had been illegally mined by a state-owned Moroccan company in occupied Western Sahara.","In May, Panamanian authorities detained a ship carrying phosphates bound for Canada, which were mined illegally in the occupied Western Sahara by a state-owned Moroccan company."
该数据将中国2011年度的投资收入逆差从268亿美元调整为853亿美元 — — 这一重大修改不但令人开始怀疑中国国际收支统计的可信度，还暴露出了经济发展路径中存在的一个问题。,The data adjusted China’s investment-income deficit for 2011 from $26.8 billion to $85.3 billion – a massive revision that casts doubt on the reliability of China’s balance-of-payments statistics and exposes a flaw in the economy’s growth path.,The data adjust China’s investment income deficit for 2011 from $26.8 billion to $85.3 billion – a major revision that calls into question the reliability of China’s balance-of-payments statistics and exposes a problem with the country’s economic development path.
同样，土耳其的欧盟事务部长埃盖曼·巴厄什（Egemen Bağış）也在不同场合与相关宗教少数群体的领袖进行了会面。,"Likewise, Turkey’s minister for European Union affairs, Egemen Bağış, has met with these communities’ leaders on several occasions.","Likewise, Turkey’s EU affairs minister, Egemen Bağış, has met with leaders of the country’s religious minorities in different settings."
她控诉说当时自己“太出名 ” 、 “太活跃”和“太受压 ” ， 并且她对毛的妻子江青如何迫害叶剑英一家以及叶剑英的孩子如何入狱提供了大量具体的细节。,"She complained that she was “too famous,” “too active,” and “too stressed” at the time, and she provided extensive details about how Mao’s wife, Jiang Qing, persecuted the Ye family and how the Ye children went to prison.","She complained that she was “too famous,” “too active,” and “too pressured” at the time, and she provided a great deal of specific detail about how Mao’s wife, Jiang Qing, had persecuted the Yang family and imprisoned Yang’s children."
而如果欧洲各国的财政部长面对汇率上的僵局感到沮丧，而一致产生独创性地管理他们的预算以刺激短期需求而不是长期增长，那将是更加糟糕的结果。,"It would be even worse if European ministers, frustrated with gridlock over exchange rates, started sharing ideas for creatively managing their budgets to stimulate short-term demand, rather than long-term growth.","And if European finance ministers, frustrated by a lack of exchange-rate flexibility, manage their budgets in a uniform and creative way to stimulate short-term demand rather than long-term growth, that would be even worse."
不管经济学家获得如此独特地位的原因何在，诺贝尔奖光环可以也确实常常让有害于公共利益 — — 比如推动不平等和增加造成金融危机的可能性 — — 的政策获得信誉。,"Whatever the reason for economists’ unique status, the halo conferred by the prize can – and often has – lend credibility to policies that harm the public interest, for example by driving inequality and making financial crises more likely.","Regardless of why economists occupy such a privileged position, the Nobel laureate’s halo often lends credence to policies that are harmful to the public interest – for example, by promoting inequality and increasing the likelihood of financial crises."
但预测危机却需要对各个经济学领域都有所涉猎的人 — — 正如我们需要一个优秀的全科医师去辨认某种外来病一样。,"Yet, to see the crisis coming would have required someone who knew about each of these areas – just as it takes a good general practitioner to recognize an exotic disease.",But forecasting crises requires people with expertise in all areas of economics – just as we need a good general practitioner to diagnose an exotic disease.
而如今他们却又面对着尖锐的职责，正如意大利中央银行行长马里奥·德拉齐指出的那样，许多国家央行的独立性都受到了极大挑战，特别是欧元区内的那几家。,"Today, however, central banks are being sharply criticized, and their independence is coming under severe pressure in many countries, particularly in the eurozone, as Mario Draghi, the head of the Bank of Italy, recently pointed out.","And now they are confronted with sharp responsibilities, as many central banks’ independence is being challenged, as Bank of Italy Governor Mario Draghi has pointed out, especially in the eurozone."
此外，根据即将发布的《经济复杂性报告 》 （ Atlas of Economic Complexity）的数据，这些经济体开始生产更复杂的产品，这是可持续增长的先兆。,"Moreover, according to the soon-to-be-published Atlas of Economic Complexity, these economies began producing more complex products, a harbinger of sustainable growth.","Moreover, according to the forthcoming Atlas of Economic Complexity, these economies are beginning to produce more complex products, a sign of sustainable growth."
为了确保今天和明天的工人能够获得信息时代的好处，我们就必须重新设计经济制度以刺激这些新型商品的创造。,To ensure that the workers of today and tomorrow are able to capture the benefits of the information age will require us to redesign our economic system to stimulate the creation of these new types of commodities.,"To ensure that today’s and tomorrow’s workers benefit from the information age, we must re-engineer economic systems to stimulate the creation of these new goods."
每年都有2.8亿吨塑料被生产出来，其中有大量塑料进入了地下水、河流和海洋 — — 并在食物链中累积。,"Every year, more than 280 million tons of plastic is produced, with vast quantities making their way into groundwater, rivers, and oceans – and onward up the food chain.","Every year, 280 million tons of plastic are produced, much of which ends up in groundwater, rivers, and oceans – accumulating in the food chain."
就像两百年前的美国革命者一样，印度民族主义者主要为“英国人的权利”而战，他们相信复制议会两院制可以体现并确保这一点。,"Like the American revolutionaries two centuries ago, Indian nationalists fought for “the rights of Englishmen,” which they thought the replication of the Houses of Parliament would epitomize and guarantee.","Like the American revolutionaries two centuries ago, Indian nationalists fought primarily for “the rights of the British,” believing that a replica of the British Parliament’s two-chamber system would enshrine and protect them."
类似地，1987年至1993年巴勒斯坦第一次抵抗运动（Intifada）后，以色列国防界领导了和平努力。,"Similarly, in the aftermath of the first Intifada, the Palestinian uprising that lasted from 1987 to 1993, the defense establishment led the effort for peace.","Similarly, after the First Palestinian Intifada of 1987-1993, Israel’s defense establishment led peace efforts."
除了家人和朋友之间的通讯之外，在新网络上传输的信息涉及了公共健康、医学治疗、教育、银行服务、商业以及娱乐等行业。,"The information carried on the new networks spans public health, medical care, education, banking, commerce, and entertainment, in addition to communications among family and friends.","Beyond communication between family and friends, information transmitted over the new networks encompasses public health, medical care, education, banking services, commerce, and entertainment."
我们已经在苹果的iPhone上看到了新范式的线索，iPhone可以进行手指动作识别，但是在智能技术界，概念可视化非常激进，以至于绝大多数的普通用户可能都不能意识到它是什么东西。,"We’ve seen hints of a new paradigm in Apple’s iPhone, which allows gestural finger motions, but in the intelligence community, concept visualization can be so radical that most ordinary users might barely recognize what it was.","We have already seen a glimpse of the new paradigm in Apple’s iPhone, which can recognize gestures, but in the world of smart technologies, the concept of visualization is so radical that most ordinary users are probably unaware of it."
在保守派一边，希拉克已经正式支持萨尔科奇，但是他可能也暗地里鼓励他最为忠诚的支持者们投贝鲁的票，即使这在两个人之间不会丧失情义。,"On the conservative side, Jacques Chirac now officially supports Sarkozy, but he may also secretly encourage his most loyal supporters to vote for Bayrou, even if there is no love lost between the two men.","On the conservative side, Chirac has officially endorsed Sarkozy, but he may also be encouraging his most loyal supporters to vote for Ségolène Royal, even though this would not be in good taste."
最积极的解释认为，马克龙已经决心要以深度果断的改革为重点，而在宏观经济问题上准备谨慎推进，一如其前任萨科齐和奥朗德。,"The most positive interpretation assumes that Macron has decided to focus on deep and courageous reforms, while approaching macroeconomic issues with caution, much like his predecessors, Nicolas Sarkozy and Hollande.","The most optimistic interpretation is that Macron has decided to prioritize deep and decisive reforms, while proceeding cautiously on the macroeconomic front, as his predecessors François Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy did."
为支持经济增长和发展，我们需要发掘所有劳动者的潜力，不仅授予女性赚钱的机会，而且要让她们担负起领导职责。,"To support economic growth and development, we need to tap the potential of all workers, giving women opportunities not just to earn, but also to lead.","To support economic growth and development, we need to unleash the potential of all workers, not just by giving women the opportunity to earn money, but also by giving them leadership roles."
关于以色列的煽动性言论加剧了想要成为伊朗伙伴的国家对它的不信任，并且使欧洲国家和美国想要和伊朗建立更良好的关系变得困难。,"Incendiary statements about Israel exacerbate the lack of trust among Iran’s would-be partners, and make it hard for those in Europe and the US who are interested in building more favorable relations.","Inflammatory rhetoric about Israel fuels distrust of it among countries that want to be Iran’s partners, and makes it more difficult for European countries and the US to improve relations with Iran."
作为最大党，国大党成为新成立的联合进步联盟（United Progressive Alliance，UPA）的主导者。,"As the largest party, Congress became the hub of the newly established United Progressive Alliance (UPA).","As the largest party, the Congress became the dominant force in the new United Progressive Alliance (UPA)."
针对性更强也更有限的全新美国作用也因此为美国的欧洲伙伴提出了这样的问题：它们能不能没有美国帮助就无法保护自身？,"This new, more focused and limited American role thus raises the following question for America’s European partners: Can they afford the luxury of being unable to defend themselves without US help?",The more targeted and limited new American role also raises questions for America’s European partners: can they defend themselves without US help?
最重要的是，要想让公司董事会 — — 以及为公司和个人提供咨询的律师、银行家和会计师 — — 严格对待法律和道德合规性问题，必须让它们相信它们将因为自己的行为而被问责。,"Most important, if corporate boards – and the lawyers, bankers, and accountants who advise companies and individuals – are to be vigilant about legal and ethical compliance, they must believe that they will be held accountable for their actions.","Most important, to get corporate boards – and the lawyers, bankers, and accountants who advise them – to take legal and ethical compliance seriously, one must convince them that they will be held accountable for their actions."
2013年年底，就业人数仍比危机前峰值低110万；要恢复峰值水平需要新增770万个岗位，以吸收后续增加的劳动力市场新军。,"Employment at the end of 2013 was still 1.1 million short of its pre-recession peak; regaining this peak requires 7.7 million more jobs, in addition to absorbing subsequent monthly entrants to the labor force.","At the end of 2013, the number of jobs was still 1.1 million below the pre-crisis peak; an additional 7.7 million jobs would be needed to restore the pre-crisis level."
归根结底，无论中国的一党制国家资本主义还是俄国的财阀政治经济都与“自由”相去甚远，而这两国也并不避讳以军事手段维护其自我认同权。,"After all, neither China’s one-party state-capitalist system nor Russia’s plutocratic political economy is particularly liberal, and neither country is especially averse to asserting its (self-identified) rights by military means.","In the end, both China’s one-party state capitalism and Russia’s oligarchic political economy are far from “free,” and both countries are not shy about defending their identities by military means."
随着新的知识不断扩散到商业活动之中，研究溢出到经济的其他部分，利用奥地利企业东欧子公司所生产的知识也成为东欧经济体实现快速增长的途径之一。,"Research spills over to the rest of the economy, as new knowledge diffuses into commercial activities. Tapping the knowledge produced by Austrian subsidiaries was one of the ways Eastern European economies were able to grow so quickly.","As new knowledge spreads to commercial activities, research spills over to other parts of the economy, and knowledge produced by Austrian firms’ Eastern European subsidiaries becomes a path to rapid growth for the region’s economies."
总体算来，发展中国家的增长率达到了每年7 % ， 发达经济体也有2%的年增长率，核算起来全球年增长约有4.5 % 。,"Overall, the developing countries are growing at around 7% per year, and the developed economies at around 2%, yielding a global average of around 4.5%.","Overall, growth in developing countries has averaged 7% per year, while advanced economies have grown at 2% per year, yielding a global annual growth rate of about 4.5%."
至于伊朗伊斯兰共和国，继任总统哈桑·鲁哈尼或许愿意就核野心问题与世界其他国家达成协议 — — 又或许他不愿意。,"As for the Islamic Republic, incoming President Hassan Rowhani may want to reach an agreement with the world on the country’s nuclear ambition – or he may not.","As for Iran’s Islamic Republic, President Hassan Rouhani’s successor may be willing to reach an agreement with the rest of the world on his country’s nuclear ambitions – or he may not be."
结果是，穆尔西的激励变成了巩固权力，而不是起草包容性宪法；在全民公投中，穆斯林兄弟会支持的宪法草案获得了64%的选民支持，但投票比例只有33 % 。,"As a result, Morsi’s incentives were to consolidate power rather than produce an inclusive constitution; put to a referendum, the draft backed by the Brotherhood was approved by 64% of voters, but with a turnout of just 33%.","As a result, Morsi’s incentive became consolidation of power, not drafting an inclusive constitution; in the referendum, the draft constitution supported by the Muslim Brotherhood received 64% of the vote, but turnout was only 33%."
在克里姆林宫的庇护下，这些地区已经沦为新闻和信息“黑洞 ” ， 在这些地方，政府可以自由行事，而不必害怕承担任何后果。,"With the Kremlin’s blessing, these regions have been turned into news and information “black holes,” where the authorities are free to act without fear of consequences.","Under the Kremlin’s protection, these regions have become “black holes” of news and information, where the government can act with impunity."
在此期间，据说副总统迪克·切尼（Dick Cheney）曾宣称前总统罗纳德·里根证明了“赤字不重要 ” 。,It was during this period that Vice President Dick Cheney reportedly declared that former President Ronald Reagan had proved that “deficits don’t matter.”,"During this period, Vice President Dick Cheney reportedly declared that former President Ronald Reagan had proven that “deficits don’t matter.”"
在那时，穆斯林的思想家们将他们自己社会的衰落与欧洲的活力进行对比。 欧洲成功地将穆斯林世界的很大部分殖民化的事实使得这种差别尤为痛苦。,"Back then, Muslim thinkers contrasted the decline of their own societies with Europe's dynamism, a particularly painful distinction in light of European successes in colonizing large parts of the Muslim world.","At the time, Muslim thinkers contrasted their society’s decline with Europe’s vitality, which was made all the more painful by Europe’s successful colonization of much of the Muslim world."
可以肯定，未来的挑战涉及面既广泛又复杂；但人们越来越清楚地认识到过渡到低碳经济收获的经济利益将十分可观。,"To be sure, the challenge ahead is as broad as it is complex; but it is becoming increasingly clear that making the transition to a low-carbon economy will bring considerable economic benefits.","Certainly, the challenges ahead are broad and complex; but the economic benefits of transitioning to a low-carbon economy are becoming increasingly apparent."
非理性繁荣的参与者根本没想过如果当局出手维持经济以及信贷流（或者在极端情况下援助银行或者企业）后自己收回多少。,"The irrationally exuberant were not thinking of the returns they would garner if the authorities intervened to maintain the economy and the flow of credit (or, in extreme cases, moved to bail out their bank or enterprise).","Participants in the non-rational boom never considered how much they would have to give back if the authorities stepped in to maintain the economy and the credit flow (or, in extreme cases, to bail out banks or firms)."
他希望德国能够脱离纳粹主义，纳粹主义能被摧毁的同时而德国不被摧毁，从而让这个伟大国家作为抵御苏联的桥头堡。,"He hoped that Germany could be separated from Nazism, that Nazism could be destroyed without destroying Germany, thus preserving that great nation as a bulwark against the Soviet Union.","He hoped that Germany could be liberated from Nazism without being destroyed, thereby preserving the great country as a bulwark against the Soviet Union."
而今天，多亏卫星、气象气球、超级计算机和经验丰富的气象预报人士，我们提前一个星期就能预见灾害性天气的到来。,"Today, thanks to satellites, weather balloons, supercomputers, and skilled forecasters, we can anticipate hazardous weather up to a week in advance.","Today, thanks to satellites, weather balloons, supercomputers, and experienced weather forecasters, we can predict the arrival of hazardous weather a week in advance."
这场战争已经变得如此生硬 — — 如此暴力 — — 以致于拉美很多人现在感到惊讶，弄不清病理性成瘾更为严重的究竟是哪一方。,So rote – and so violent – has that war become that many people in Latin America now wonder which side is suffering the more pathological addiction.,The war has become so brutal – so bloody – that many in Latin America now wonder which side is addicted to cynicism more.
但是，他实施了一项在到期时替换日本银行资产负债表上的政府债券，同时不断增加央行账目上的政府债券数量的政策。,"Nonetheless, he has initiated a policy of replacing the government bonds on the BOJ’s balance sheet once they mature, while constantly increasing the volume of government debt on the central bank’s books.","But he implemented a policy of replacing government bonds on the Bank of Japan’s balance sheet as they matured with government bonds, while continuing to increase the amount of government bonds on the Bank’s balance sheet."
在这样的背景下，巴西20世纪70年代开始的推动可再生燃料发展的经验直接关系到今天对行业政策截然相反的观点。,"In this vein, Brazil’s experience at promoting renewable fuels, beginning in the 1970’s, is directly relevant to today’s polarized views of industrial policy.","Against this backdrop, Brazil’s experience in promoting renewable-energy development in the 1970’s is directly relevant to today’s opposite view of industry policy."
除此之外还面临着内忧外患 — — 包括伊斯兰主义兴起、内战和人口大规模逃离冲突区 — — 一些阿拉伯国家的未来面临不确定性。,"Add to that external and internal pressures – including from surging Islamism, civil wars, and mass migration from conflict zones – and the future of several Arab countries appears uncertain.","Beyond that, the future of several Arab countries is uncertain, owing to internal challenges – including the rise of Islamism, civil war, and large-scale population displacement from conflict zones."
一旦这些援助迅��到位，从前的士兵就会返回到自己的故里，并在敌对状态结束后通过种植第一季庄稼开始新的生活。,"When such aid is made available quickly, former soldiers will return to their farms, and can establish a livelihood by the beginning of the first growing season following the end of hostilities.","Once the aid arrives, the former soldiers will return to their homes and begin a new life by planting their first season’s crop after the war ends."
在这样阴郁而艰难的大背景下，世界领导人正在这里召开联合国气候变化大会制定新的全球协议实现温室气体减排。,"In this subdued and challenging context, world leaders are now convening in the city at the United Nations Climate Change Conference to hammer out a new global agreement to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.","Against this gloomy and difficult backdrop, world leaders are meeting here to negotiate a new global agreement to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions."
其他气候学家则更加乐观：他们指出，如果我们让大气二氧化碳上升至450 ppm，并由此带来2摄氏度的气温升高，我们仍有66.6%的机会避免灾难。,"Other climate scientists are more optimistic: they argue that if we allow atmospheric CO2 to rise to 450 ppm, a level associated with a two-degree Celsius temperature rise, we have a 66.6% chance of avoiding catastrophe.","Other climate scientists are more optimistic: they argue that if we let atmospheric CO2 rise to 450 ppm and thus cause 2°C of warming, we still have a 66.6% chance of avoiding catastrophe."
但摩擦力产生热量并因此导致熵的增加 — — 熵代表一种测量在动力学方面不能做功的能量总数 — — 并因此将过去和未来区分开来。,Yet friction produces heat and thus an increase in entropy – which measures the amount of energy that cannot be used to perform work – and it therefore distinguishes past from future.,But friction generates heat and thus increases entropy – a measure of the total amount of energy that a dynamical system cannot do work – and thus separates the past from the future.
而以色列-巴勒斯坦和平进程长期以来的一个基本点是巴勒斯坦人行使民族自决权只能在1967年前边界之外的另一个国家中。,And the Israeli-Palestinian peace process has long been based on the principle that the Palestinians should exercise their right of national self-determination in a separate state on the other side of the pre-1967 borders.,One of the basic points of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process has long been that Palestinians can exercise their right to national self-determination only in another country beyond the 1967 borders.
而美国评论员 — — 以及越来越多的法官 — — 都想把企业的首席执行官和董事会与其公司的交易股东进一步隔离开来。,"American commentators – and, increasingly, US judges – want to insulate CEOs and boards further from their firms’ trading shareholders.",American commentators – and an increasing number of judges – want to further insulate corporate CEOs and boards from their company’s shareholders.
此外，烟民和PNV使用者一口一口地吞云吐雾，可以非常精确地控制他们所消费的尼古丁剂量，几乎完全杜绝了过量吸入风险。,"Moreover, smokers and PNV users control very precisely, on a puff-by-puff basis, the dose of nicotine they consume, virtually eliminating the risk of overdose.","Moreover, smokers and PNV users can precisely control the amount of nicotine they consume, virtually eliminating the risk of over-inhalation."
而它其实没有必要这样做：事后看来，我们似乎有理由假设如果中国人民银行能多一点耐心，2015年8月改革的成果就可能坚持下来。,"And it didn’t have to: with the benefit of hindsight, it seems reasonable to assume that, had the PBOC simply been more patient, it could have stuck with the August 2015 reform.","It didn’t have to be that way: in retrospect, it seems reasonable to assume that the reforms of August 2015 would have stuck if the PBOC had been a little more patient."
事实上，从2000到2004年，净政府开支额的增长占了收入增长的150 ％ ， 而其它的收入来源枯竭了。,"Indeed, from 2000 to 2004, the increase in net government expenditures accounted for 150% of income growth, as other sources of income shriveled up.","Indeed, from 2000 to 2004, net government spending grew by 150% of income, while other sources of income dried up."
因此尽管P5+1集团（中国、法国、俄罗斯、英国、美国，再加上德国）在哈萨克斯坦会议上已做出让步，谈判没有进展也并不出人意料。,"So it was no surprise that itdid not, despite the concessions that were made at the meeting in Kazakhstan by the P5+1 (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, plus Germany).","So, while the P5+1 group (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany) made concessions at the Kazakhstan meeting, it is not surprising that negotiations have not progressed."
但大部分过度储蓄、支出不足的国家并没有减少储蓄、增加支出；它们的经常项目盈余一直在增加，加剧了全球需求的疲软，因而拖累增长。,"But most countries that were over-saving and under-spending have not saved less and spent more; their current-account surpluses have been growing, aggravating the weakness of global demand and thus undermining growth.","But most countries with excessive saving and insufficient spending have not reduced saving and increased spending; their current-account surpluses have continued to grow, weakening global demand and thus depressing growth."
国际谈判的成功取决于各方 — — 以及他们所代表的人民 — — 如何看待关键的公平原则，特别是历史责任和等人均权利。,"Success in international negotiations will hinge on how parties – and the citizens they represent – consider a few vital equity principles, especially historical responsibility and equal per capita rights.","The success of international negotiations depends on how parties – and the people they represent – view key principles of fairness, especially historical responsibility and equal rights."
要求政府测试动用武力决定的事实依据并不是一个应当抛弃的枷锁，而是鼓励深谋远虑以及在心理上让人安心的支持。,"Requiring the government to test the factual basis of its decision to use force is not a shackle to be thrown off, but an incentive for forethought and a psychologically stabilizing support.","The requirement that governments test the factual basis of their decisions to use force is not a constraint to be discarded, but an encouragement to deep reflection and psychologically reassuring support."
如果本地银行遭遇挤兑，或者公司难以延展债务，它们就必须能够从本地央行借到美元，而本地央行又只能从美联储获得美元。,"If local banks suffer a run, or if corporations have trouble rolling over their debt, they need to be able to borrow dollars from the local central bank, which in turn may have no choice but to get those dollars from the Fed.","If local banks are squeezed, or companies find it difficult to roll over their debt, they must be able to borrow dollars from their local central bank, which in turn must borrow dollars from the Fed."
和这种个人化相关的大脑区域是从我们的贸易伙伴还是小型氏族团体成员的时候开始进化的。 在那样的情况下，违反道德的行为会被即时发现并加以纠正。,This personalization draws upon regions of the brain that evolved when our trading partners were members of small kin-based groups where moral violations were immediately identified and remedied.,"The brain regions associated with this personalization evolved when we were trading partners or members of small clan groups, in which violations of moral norms were quickly detected and corrected."
这部分是因为FDIC需要在金融部门企业倒闭时收拾残局，因此其高级官员有强烈的激励通过防止风险失控保护保险资金。,"In part, this is because the FDIC is responsible for cleaning up the mess when financial-sector firms fail, so its senior officials have a strong incentive to protect its insurance fund by preventing risks from getting out of control.","This is because the FDIC needs to clean up the mess when financial-sector firms fail, so its senior officials have a strong incentive to protect insured deposits by preventing risk-taking from getting out of control."
但尽管习近平目前有能力去应对日益复杂和敌对的外部经济环境，其国内依然存在着许多即将爆发的严重内部问题。,"But while Xi has thus far managed to deal with an increasingly complex and hostile external economic environment, many serious internal concerns could easily erupt into bigger problems.","But, despite Xi’s ability to navigate an increasingly complex and hostile external economic environment, serious internal problems remain."
墨西哥可以利用一系列移民工具，如放松对危地马拉南部边境的控制，或者在美国当局无法证明其墨西哥国籍的情况下拒绝从美国接纳被驱逐者。,"Mexico can use a number of tools on immigration, such as loosening controls on its southern border with Guatemala or refusing admission to deportees from the US unless American authorities can corroborate their Mexican nationality.","Mexico could use a variety of immigration tools, such as loosening control of its southern border with Guatemala, or refusing to accept deportees from the US if the US authorities cannot prove their Mexican nationality."
正如诺贝尔经济学奖得主肯尼斯·阿罗在1972年指出的那样 ， “ 互信的缺失可以解释世界上绝大多数的经济落后 。 ”,"As the Nobel laureate economist Kenneth Arrow argued in 1972, “much of the economic backwardness in the world can be explained by the lack of mutual confidence.”","As Kenneth Arrow, a Nobel laureate in economics, pointed out in 1972, “the absence of mutual trust can explain much of the world’s economic backwardness.”"
简而言之，西方的对乌战略应该是在大选之前刺激该国经济，然后再与大选后建立的政府谈判建立一个改革方案。,"In short, the Western strategy for Ukraine should be to stimulate the Ukrainian economy until the May election and then negotiate a package of reforms with the government that emerges.","In short, the West’s approach to Ukraine should be to stimulate the country’s economy before the election, and then to negotiate a reform program with the government that emerges after the election."
美国国会的冥顽不化导致基金组织错过了一个在其他大多数国家都批准了决议的情况下强化自身资金实力的机会。,Congressional obstinacy is forcing the Fund to miss out on an opportunity to strengthen its finances at a time when most other countries have already approved the initiative.,The US Congress’s intransigence has deprived the fund of an opportunity to strengthen its finances at a time when most countries have ratified the resolution.
进入劳务市场的人数要比同时期的退出人数高200，000到300，000¾而移民还未被计算在内，虽然近年来的移民数量有所减少，但仍然是寻找工作的主要力量。,"In France, by contrast, 200,000 to 300,000 more people enter the labor market than leave it in each generation – and this does not include immigration, which, although slowing recently, represents a large number of job seekers.","The number of people entering the labor market is 200,000 to 300,000 higher than the number leaving it – not counting immigrants, whose numbers have declined in recent years, but who remain the main force seeking work."
那些经常账户赤字数额巨大的国家（印度，南非，以及从波罗的海国家到土耳其的位于东欧的20多个国家）会因为全球信贷紧缩受到不利影响。,"Those with large current-account deficits (India, South Africa, and more than 20 economies in East Europe from the Baltics to Turkey) may suffer from the global credit crunch.","Countries with large current-account deficits (India, South Africa, and the 20-plus countries in Eastern Europe) would be adversely affected by a global credit squeeze."
如今，不论在欧洲，亚洲还是美国，民粹运动者的论调是，精英阶层过于强大，他们主宰者普通民众一切，广大民众的声音被那些自由派人士，多文化主义者和城市精英所淹没。,"The tone of populist movements, whether in Europe, Asia, or the US, would suggest that the elites are too powerful, that they dominate the little people, whose voices are drowned out by the liberals, the multiculturalists, and the city slickers.","Nowadays, whether in Europe, Asia, or the United States, populists argue that the elites are too powerful, and that ordinary people’s voices are drowned out by those of liberals, multiculturalists, and urban elites."
约翰·米勒在其维护言论自由的经典著作《论自由》一书中写道，如果一个观点没有“得到完全、经常以及毫不畏惧地讨论 ” ， 它将成为“一个僵死的教条，而不是有活力的真理 。 ”,"In his classic defense of freedom of speech in, On Liberty, John Stuart Mill wrote that if a view is not “fully, frequently, and fearlessly discussed,” it will become “a dead dogma, not a living truth.”","As John Stuart Mill wrote in his classic defense of free speech, On Liberty, “if the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth; if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error.”"
历史也驳斥了芝加哥大学经济学家亨利·西蒙（Henry Simon）所呼吁的货币政策“规则而不是当局 ” 。,History has refuted the University of Chicago economist Henry Simons’s call for “rules rather than authorities” in monetary policy.,"History also refutes the call for monetary policy “rules, not men” by the University of Chicago economist Henry Simon."
但是，资本存量相对于产出不断增加意味着不断降低的资本回报，假以时日，这将给银行部门带来更多的不良贷款。,"An ever-increasing capital stock relative to output, however, means ever-lower returns to capital and thus ever more non-performing loans in the banking sector over time.","But, as capital stock relative to output rises, the return on capital falls, implying more bad loans in the banking sector."
这些企业比传统制造业更能体现合作性和共享性，帮助了消费者和小型初创企业来参与决定产品和服务的内容，包括影响从设计到分销的各个供应链环节。,"These businesses are more collaborative or sharing than the traditional business of manufacturing, allowing consumers and smaller start-ups to shape products and services, from design to distribution.","These firms are more collaborative and shareable than traditional manufacturers, helping consumers and small start-ups to participate in the content of products and services, from design to distribution."
首先，银行是主要债权人，任何重组都会给它们带来巨大的损失，必然会造成多米诺效应，悲观情绪的蔓延将导致利率升高、毁掉其他借款人的光明前景。,"First, banks were the primary creditors, and the large losses that they would face in any restructuring was bound to trigger a domino effect, with waves of pessimism driving up interest rates and ruining other borrowers’ prospects.","For starters, banks are the main creditors, and any restructuring would impose large losses on them, triggering the Domino Effect, with pessimism spreading and leading to higher interest rates and bleak prospects for other borrowers."
从1985到1995年雅克·德洛尔任委员会主席以来，再也没有有远见或政治影响力的领袖担任过委员会主席职务。,"Not since Jacques Delors was President of the Commission, from 1985 to 1995, has that position been filled by a leader with any vision or political clout.","Since Jacques Delors chaired the Commission from 1985 to 1995, no visionary or politically influential leader has held the post."
从1950年代到1980年代所进行的早期欧洲一体化使大国获得了显著得可以让政治家们轻易展现给选民看的利益。,"In the earlier rounds of European integration, from the 1950’s to the 1980’s, the big states received very obvious gains, which their politicians could easily present as such to voters.",Early European integration in the 1950’s and 1960’s delivered tangible benefits that politicians could easily show to voters.
艾滋病毒疫苗临床试验在2017年年底启动，南非医生报告治愈了一位男幼童的艾滋病。 他从婴儿阶段接受治疗。,"Clinical trials for an HIV vaccine started at the end of 2017, while doctors in South Africa reported curing a young boy of the disease after he received treatments as an infant.","Clinical trials of the HIV vaccine began in late 2017, and South African doctors reported curing a young boy of HIV, who had received treatment as an infant."
今天，许多投资者把他们以前心目中无能的政府庞然大物看作金融天才，它们可以驾驭复杂的金融公式并且利用它们的超大规模和贸易信息来挤压利率和汇率市场的活力。,"Today, many traders see formerly inept state giants as financial geniuses, capable of taming complex financial formulas and exploiting their superior size and trading information to squeeze the life out of currency and interest rate markets.","Today, many investors view their formerly clueless governments as financial wizards, able to manipulate complex financial formulas and use their vast size and trade information to squeeze life out of interest-rate and exchange-rate markets."
我们欧洲人可以划定我们自己的红线，警告俄罗斯，如果越线，我们将收紧对俄制裁，因为从此以后它将为其叙利亚附庸的罪行负责。,"We in Europe can draw our own red line, warning Russia that, if the line is crossed, we will increase sanctions against it as a state henceforth held to be responsible for the crimes of its Syrian vassal.","We Europeans can draw our own red lines, warning Russia that if it crosses them, we will tighten our sanctions against it, because from now on it will be responsible for the crimes of its Syrian puppet."
然而，眼下正有传言，说 IMF 总裁多米尼克·施特劳斯 — 卡恩打算卸任，参加 2012 年法国总统大选，跟萨尔科齐一角高低。,"Now, however, the rumor mill is heating up with gossip that the Fund’s managing director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, will leave in order to oppose Nikolas Sarkozy in the 2012 French presidential elections.","However, there are rumors that IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn – who is said to be considering stepping down to run for the French presidency in 2012 – is angling to succeed Sarkozy."
目前欧元的构建者之一雅克•德洛尔称，自己创造单一货币的想法是好的，但是“实施的过程”有缺陷，因为较弱的国家举债过多。,"Jacques Delors, one of the architects of the euro, now claims that his idea for a single currency was good, but that its “execution” was flawed, because the weaker countries were allowed to borrow too much.","Jacques Delors, one of the architects of the euro, has said that the idea of a single currency was a good one, but that the “process of implementation” was flawed, because the weaker countries borrowed too much."
直接或间接主宰新加坡半个多世纪的李光耀直到91岁逝世前都极富影响力 — — 他的掌权时间超过了大多数人。,"Lee Kuan Yew, who presided over Singapore either directly or indirectly for more than a half-century – remaining influential right up to his death at 91 – had more time in power than most to do so.","Lee Kuan Yew, who dominated Singapore for more than half a century, until his death at the age of 91, was influential – he ruled longer than most."
而这种逻辑跳跃似乎在6月召开的峰会上得到了更多信任，在那次峰会上金正恩重申“他坚定不移地致力于实现朝鲜半岛的无核化 。 ”,"And this leap of logic seemed to gain more credence at the summit in June, where Kim “reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.”","This leap of faith was reinforced at the June summit, when Kim reiterated his “firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.”"
虽然富裕女性可以也确实付钱给贫困女性承担照顾工作，但也有很多人选择兼职或弹性工作以便履行子女的鼓励和教育职责。,"Although wealthy women can and do buy the care work of poorer women, many also choose to work part-time or flexibly to provide the stimulation and education their children need.","While wealthy women can and do pay poorer women to care for their children, many choose to work part-time or flexibly in order to fulfill their responsibilities to their children."
1995年5月和8月初相继爆发的克罗地亚攻势从塞族分裂势力的控制下收复了四块中的三块联合国保护领土。,"Croatian military offensives, first in early May 1995, and a second in early August, had taken back three of four United Nations-protected sectors from separatist Serb control.",The Croat offensives of May and early August 1995 recaptured three of the four UN-protected territories under Serb control.
传统智慧一直认为军队规模最大的国家将会胜出，但在信息时代获胜的也许是最会讲故事的国家（或非国家 ） 。,"Conventional wisdom has always held that the state with the largest military prevails, but in an information age it may be the state (or non-state) with the best story that wins.","Conventional wisdom holds that the country with the largest army will win, but in the age of information, perhaps the country with the best story (or non-state actor) will win."
大多数美国人都支持提高最低工资，有7位诺贝尔经济学奖得主也表示赞成；希望硅谷的那些全民基本收入倡导者们也能如此。,"A majority of Americans support raising the minimum wage, as do seven Nobel laureates in economics; one hopes that Silicon Valley’s UBI proselytizers do, too.","Most Americans support an increase in the minimum wage, as do seven Nobel laureates in economics; let’s hope the advocates of a universal basic income in Silicon Valley do as well."
关税的最后关键支持者是美国贸易代表罗伯特·莱希泽（Robert Lighthizer ） ， 他以前曾在钢铁行业担任过律师。,"A final key supporter of the tariffs is US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who formerly worked as a lawyer for the steel industry.","The final key supporter of tariffs is US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a former steel industry lawyer."
但这也无法确保塔利班会动用武力阻止他们的基地组织盟友在阿富汗境内重组武装力量，并利用这些力量对其他国家发动新一轮恐怖袭击。,But it is hard to imagine the Taliban using force to prevent their al-Qaeda allies from reestablishing a military presence in Afghanistan and exploiting that presence to organize additional terrorist attacks in other countries.,But it does not guarantee that the Taliban will use force to prevent their Al Qaeda allies from regrouping in Afghanistan and using those forces to launch new terrorist attacks elsewhere.
但是现在局势飘忽不定，自助还是不足。 现在需要各国政府和中央银行动手，因为只有它们才规模足够庞大，行动足够迅速。,"But in a climate of profound uncertainty, self-help is not enough. Governments or central banks are needed, because only they are both big and quick enough.","But now is the time for governments and central banks to act, because only they have the scale and speed to do so."
全世界只有不到一半的学龄难民儿童有学可上；有不到1/4的人能上到中学；不到1％的人可以继续接受高等教育。,Fewer than half of school-age refugee children worldwide attend school; not even one in four make it to secondary school; and under 1% go on to pursue a higher education.,Less than half of the world’s school-age refugee children are in school; less than one-quarter are in secondary school; and less than 1% have access to higher education.
2012年行动援助（Action Aid）调查发现，针对妇女的暴力变得更加普遍了，87%的妇女遭受着家庭暴力。,"A 2012 Action Aid survey found that violence against women has never been more prevalent, with 87% of women suffering domestic abuse.",A 2012 survey by Action Aid found that 87% of women had experienced domestic violence.
事实上，在一个对新兴经济体前景日渐担忧的世界里，由于财政状况稳定，加上美国经济复苏势头增强带来的商品需求增加预期，墨西哥正面临着一次机遇。,"Indeed, in a world that has grown nervous about emerging economies, Mexico stands out as an island of opportunity, with a stable fiscal position and the prospect of rising demand for its goods as the US recovery gathers momentum.","Indeed, in a world that is increasingly pessimistic about emerging economies’ prospects, Mexico has an opportunity, owing to its fiscal stability and expected increase in commodity demand as the US economy recovers."
1856年出生在目前克罗地亚境内一个东正教塞尔维亚家庭，特斯拉的国籍到现在仍然是巴尔干地区争论的对象。,"Born into an Orthodox Serbian family in 1856 in a town that is now part of Croatia, Tesla’s nationality remains an object of debate in the region.","Born in 1856 to an Eastern Orthodox Serbian family in what is now Croatia, Tesla’s citizenship remains a subject of debate in the Balkans."
保卫银行部门健康的果断措施之所以必不可少，不但是因为这样能够减轻困扰市场的风险，也因为健康的金融机构是经济增长的基石。,"Decisive steps to safeguard the banking sector’s health are necessary not only to reduce some of the risks that are preoccupying markets, but also because healthy financial institutions are vital for economic growth.","The need for decisive action to safeguard the health of the banking sector is not only to reduce the risk to markets, but also because healthy financial institutions are the bedrock of economic growth."
此外，世界 — — 不仅是西方世界，也包括俄罗斯和中国 — — 也将面临全球性的毒品、军火和恐怖行动扩散的危险。,"Moreover, the world – not just the West, but Russia and China as well – would risk global proliferation of drugs, weapons, and terror.","Moreover, the world – not just the West, but also Russia and China – faces the danger of a global spread of drugs, arms, and terrorism."
日益增加的球员跨国流动使得各国球技水平走向趋同，这一点从阿根廷、巴西、法国、德国，意大利和西班牙等传统足球强国的统治地位下降上可以看出。,"The increased movement of players across borders has already contributed to a convergence among countries’ skill levels, reflected in the declining dominance of traditional powerhouses like Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain.","Increasing player mobility has led to convergence in national skill levels, as evidenced by the decline of traditional football powers like Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain."
欧洲如今已经在欧洲中央银行任命有一位单一监管人，但它缺乏一个共同的存款保险方案，而德国官员反对该方案的理由是欧洲银行系统的风险还未降到合理水平。,"Europe now has a single supervisor in the European Central Bank, but it lacks a common deposit insurance scheme, which German officials oppose on the grounds that there has been inadequate risk reduction in the European banking system.","Europe now has a single supervisor at the European Central Bank, but it lacks a common deposit-insurance scheme, and German officials oppose it on the grounds that risks in the European banking system are not yet low enough."
危机是在所有领域 — — 包括便利在发展中国家逃税的富裕国家的银行业务 — — 取得更大透明度的机会。,"The crisis is an opportunity to achieve greater transparency on all fronts, including banking practices in rich countries that facilitate tax evasion in developing nations.",The crisis provides an opportunity for greater transparency in all areas – including banking services for the wealthy in developing countries.
遗憾的是，美国总统奥巴马及其政府仍未能理解这给美国在其欧洲盟友中间的信誉所造成的伤害的广度和严重度。,"Regrettably, US President Barack Obama and his administration have yet to comprehend the scale and severity of the damage caused to America’s credibility among its European allies.","Unfortunately, US President Barack Obama and his administration have yet to understand the extent and severity of the damage to America’s reputation among its European allies."
工作、学习、休闲、保持健康和“生产性”应该成为我们生活的连续统的一部分，政策目标应该明确指向促进这一连续统、增加可测福祉。,"Working, learning, enjoying leisure, and being healthy and “productive” should be part of a continuum in our lives, and policies should be explicitly aimed at what facilitates this continuum and increases measured wellbeing.","Work, learning, leisure, health, and “productivity” should be part of a continuum in our lives, with policy objectives aimed at promoting that continuum and increasing measurable well-being."
但他们的观点被西尼尔（Nassau Senior）反对，他认为就连食品救济都不应该有：尽管数百万人因爱尔兰土豆饥荒丧命，但“这远远不够 。 ”,"But they were balanced by those like Nassau Senior, who spoke out against even famine relief: Although a million people would die in the Irish Potato Famine, “that would scarcely be enough.”","But their views were opposed by Nassau Senior, who argued that even food relief should not be given: although millions died in the Irish potato famine, “that was not enough.”"
美联储不保留投票记录，但其主要决策的“持异见者”会被披露（在艾伦·格林斯潘（Alan Greenspan）任美联储主席期间几乎没有持异见者，而在最近持异见者变得普遍起来 ） 。,"The Fed does not keep a voting record, but “dissents” from its major decisions are noted (these were almost unheard of when Alan Greenspan was Chairman, but have since become more common).","The Fed does not keep records of individual votes, but the “dissenters” on its most important decisions (which were almost nonexistent during Alan Greenspan’s tenure as Fed Chairman, but have become more common in recent years) are revealed."
此外，在提前退休政策下欧盟约有3000万65岁以下的养老金领取者，也就是说大约25％的欧洲退休人员根本不算老。,"Moreover, as a result of early-retirement policies, around 30 million pensioners across the EU are under 65 years old, which is to say that about 25% of all European retirees are not old at all.","Moreover, under early retirement policies, the EU has about 30 million pensioners under the age of 65, or about 25% of Europe’s retirees."
事实上，日本至今仍在与失衡作斗争，因为它无法或不愿采取急需的结构改革 — — 即首相安倍晋三的被称为“A安倍经济学”的经济复苏战略的所谓的“第三支箭 ” 。,"In fact, it still struggles with imbalances today, owing to its inability or unwillingness to embrace badly needed structural reforms – the so-called “third arrow” of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic recovery strategy, known as “Abenomics.”","Indeed, Japan is still struggling with imbalances, because it has been unable or unwilling to undertake the urgently needed structural reforms – the so-called “third arrow” of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic-recovery strategy, known as “Abenomics.”"
此外，金融市场在很大程度上认定量化宽松已经是板上钉钉的事情，以至于其中绝大多数的债券利率和汇率都已经提前出现了变动。,"Moreover, financial markets consider QE so likely that the largest part of its bond-rate and exchange-rate consequences have already been priced in.","Moreover, financial markets have largely priced in quantitative easing as a done deal, with most bond and exchange-rate yields already having moved."
降低公路事故死亡率是一个重要目标，科技公司的更多参与（以及老牌汽车公司的竞争）应该受到欢迎，符合改善公路安全性的利益。,"Reducing road fatalities is an important goal, and the growing engagement of tech companies (and competition with the established auto companies) should be welcomed, in the interest of improving road safety.","Reducing the death toll from road accidents is an important goal, and more involvement by tech companies (and competition from established carmakers) should be welcomed, in the interest of improving road safety."
除了这些人口监测功能之外，该登记系统还能使个人健康服务提供者和病人同时了解糖化血红蛋白的升降情况，进而对病人治疗方案提供支持。,"Beyond these population-based surveillance functions, the registry was able to support patient care by ensuring that individual health-care providers and patients were made aware of elevated or rising HbA1c levels.","In addition to its population-monitoring function, the registry also enables health-care providers and patients to be aware of changes in HbA1c levels, thereby supporting treatment decisions."
普罗迪的左翼l’Union联盟是遍布所有政治领域的一个各党大杂烩，从坚定的共产主义者到以前的自由主义者（上次选举中共产主义者势力更强 ） 。,"Prodi’s left-wing l’Unione coalition comprises a hodge-podge of parties spread all over the political spectrum, ranging from staunch communists to former liberals (with communists stronger than in the previous election).","Prodi’s left-wing coalition, l’Union, is a hodgepodge of parties from across the political spectrum, ranging from hard-core communists to former liberals (whom communists outnumbered in the last election)."
必须避免做出那些导致空中楼阁计划以及非理性预期的过度乐观估计，因为刚刚摆脱内战的当地政府将无力完成这些项目，当年在危地马拉发生的一切就是一个例子。,"Avoid overly optimistic projections that lead to unworkable plans and unreasonable expectations, which the government will not be able to fulfill, as happened in Guatemala, for example, when its civil war ended.","Care must be taken to avoid overly optimistic and unrealistic expectations, as was the case in Guatemala in the 1990’s, when the local government, just emerging from a civil war, was unable to carry out such projects."
在最近闭幕的第十一届全国人民代表大会上，讨论中听到最多的词是“幸福 ” ， 而不是以往官方词汇中的最常用的“经济发展 ” 。,"At the recently concluded 11th People’s National Congress, the word heard most often in policy discussions was “happiness,” which had suddenly replaced “economic growth” as the official mantra.","At the just-concluded 11th National People’s Congress, the buzzword was “happiness,” not “economic development,” as it has been in the past."
中国的问题不在于美国，而在于如何让这个世界第一大或第二大（取决于使用和中数据）经济体摆脱对煤炭的深度依赖。,"China’s problem is not the US, but how to wean the world’s largest, or second largest economy (depending on which data are used) off its deeply entrenched dependence on coal.","China’s problem is not the US, but how to wean the world’s largest or second-largest (depending on the measure) economy from its deep dependence on coal."
到去年9月，印度《经济时报 》 （ Economic Times）报道，出于这一风险，大部分年轻印度政客在社交网站上并不活跃。,"As recently as last September, India’s Economic Times reported that, faced with such risks, most young Indian politicians were not active on any social-networking site.","As the Economic Times of India reported last September, for this reason, most young Indian politicians are not active on social media."
有了国会的支持和促增长政策，波多黎各就能够吸引有才华的美国人（和合法移民）来到岛上创办公司，努力工��。,"With congressional support and pro-growth policies, Puerto Rico can attract talented Americans (and legal immigrants) to move to the island, start companies, and work hard.","With congressional support and pro-growth policies, Puerto Rico could attract talented Americans (and legal immigrants) to the island to start businesses and work."
布隆博格市场杂志最近发表了一篇文章，详尽报道最大的合同研究组织在佛罗里达州进行某些临床试验的不合乎伦理的做法。,Bloomberg Market magazine recently published an extensive article on the unethical practices of the largest contract research organization conducting some clinical trials in Florida.,Bloomberg Markets recently published an article detailing the unethical practices of the largest contract research organization (CRO) in conducting some clinical trials in Florida.
事实上，拜登之旅加深了日本的安全担心，因为这强调了美国重在平衡其在东亚的关系，即使这意味着容忍���张主义的中国，把它视为与盟友日本一样重要的战略考虑点。,"In fact, Biden’s tour deepened Japan’s security concerns, because it highlighted America’s focus on balancing its relationships in East Asia, even if that means tolerating an expansionist China as the strategic equivalent of an allied Japan.","Indeed, Biden’s visit reinforced Japan’s security concerns, as it underscored America’s focus on balancing its relations in East Asia, even if that means tolerating a more assertive China as a strategic consideration equal to that of its ally, Japan."
悲观者认为更多的人意味着更少的食物，上升的资源需求意味着枯竭和战争，而近几十年来，扩张的产能意味着更多的污染和全球变暖。,"Pessimists see a world where more people means less food, where rising demand for resources means depletion and war, and, in recent decades, where boosting production capacity means more pollution and global warming.","Pessimists argue that more people mean less food, rising resource demands mean depletion and war, and expanded capacity in recent decades has meant more pollution and global warming."
希腊经济正在崩溃，人道主义危机日益严重，若无法达成协议，其政府将别无选择，只能印钱提供基本社会服务。,"Given Greece’s collapsing economy and growing humanitarian crisis, the government will have no choice, absent an agreement, but to print money to fund basic social services.","The Greek economy is collapsing, humanitarian crises are mounting, and the government will have no choice but to print money and provide basic social services if no agreement is reached."
所谓的政策措施的“成本计算 ” （ 确定某项改革所带来的节约的精确数字）需要专业技能和活的大量数据。,The so-called “costing” of policy measures (determining the exact amount of savings brought about by a reform) requires technical skills and access to extensive data.,The so-called “cost-benefit analysis” (determining exactly how much a reform saves) requires specialized skills and large amounts of data.
公开信的其中一个联署者，哈佛大学的罗伯特·巴罗（Robert Barro）教授随后在Project Syndicate平台上发表了对税收计划增长效应的更深入阐述，而萨默斯和弗尔曼也做出了回应。,"Another signatory, Harvard University’s Robert Barro, then published a deeper elaboration of the tax plan’s growth effects here at Project Syndicate, to which Summers and Furman offered a response.","One of the letter’s signatories, Harvard University’s Robert Barro, then elaborated on the growth effects of the tax plan on the Project Syndicate platform, to which Summers and Furman responded."
因此为了确定关税是否实际上保护了特​​定美国部门的增值部分 — — 工资和利润 — — 还必须考虑到现在面临征税的进口产品中的美国增值部分。,"So, to determine whether tariffs are actually protecting the value added – wages and profits – in a particular US sector, one must also account for the US value added within imports that are now facing levies.","Thus, in order to determine whether tariffs actually protect the value-added portion of a particular US sector – wages and profits – one must consider the value-added portion of imports that are now being taxed."
当然，上海国际能源交易所按交易量计算仍落后于在伦敦交易的布伦特原油合约以及在纽约交易的西德克萨斯中质原油期货合同。,Of course the volume of trades on the Shanghai INE still lags behind that of the Brent oil contracts traded in London and the West Texas Intermediate oil futures traded in New York.,"Of course, the Shanghai International Energy Exchange still lags behind the Brent crude futures contract traded in London and the West Texas Intermediate crude futures contract traded in New York in terms of trading volume."
第三，卡什卡利提出手段的时机与新“区块链（blockchain ） ” 技术的到来恰巧同步，使得人们可能以更分散的方式来组织金融交易。,"Third, Kashkari’s timing coincides with the arrival of new “blockchain” technology, which makes it possible to organize financial transactions in a more decentralized way.","Third, the timing of Kasparov’s proposal coincides with the arrival of the new “blockchain” technology, which could enable financial transactions to be organized in a more decentralized way."
地区经济溢出效应因为借款人能够继续保持正常运行这一事实而得到遏制：信誉由借款人的基本面决定，而不是由其在哪个州决定。,The regional economic spillovers are limited by the fact that other borrowers can continue to function normally: creditworthiness is determined by a borrower’s fundamentals and not its state of residence.,"The spillover effect of regional economies is mitigated by the fact that borrowers can continue to operate normally: creditworthiness is determined by the borrower’s fundamentals, not by where the borrower is located."
报告中说“喜马拉雅冰川比世界其他地方的冰川要消失得更快 ” ， 接着补充说“如果保持现在这个消失速度不变，那么这些冰川很有可能在 2035 年或甚至更早的时间内完全消失 。 ”,"“Glaciers in the Himalaya are receding faster than in any other part of the world,” the report noted, adding that “if the present rate continues, the likelihood of them disappearing by the year 2035 and perhaps sooner is very high.”","The report states that “the Himalayan glaciers are receding faster than in any other part of the world,” and then adds that “if the present rate of recession continues, the glaciers very likely will be gone by 2035 or sooner.”"
一如它在苏菲派神殿事件上所做的声明那样，该组织否认参与对美国领事馆的袭击，并强调引发此次袭击的主要是侮辱先知的行为。,"Like its statement on the destruction of Sufi shrines, it denied involvement in the attack on the US Consulate, but stressed the gravity of the insult against the Prophet that putatively triggered it.","As it did in the case of the Sufi shrine, the group denied involvement in the attack on the US embassy, stressing that the main motivation was the desecration of the Prophet."
其实，不仅全球绝大多数政府和科学家无法接受对人类生殖细胞进行改造；包括英国在内的40多个国家都明令禁止这种作法。,"Indeed, not only do most scientists and governments worldwide consider human germline genetic modification unacceptable; it is expressly prohibited in more than 40 countries, including the UK.","Indeed, not only do most governments and scientists reject the idea of modifying human germ cells; 40-plus countries, including the UK, have explicitly banned it."
政策制定者们如今正在引导阿尔巴尼亚侨民去发挥重要作用 — — 因为他们是人才、投资，市场机会和商业创意的重要来源。,"And policymakers are now engaging Albania’s diaspora – found to be an important source of talent, investment, market opportunities, and business ideas – to great effect.","Policy makers are now guiding Albania’s diaspora to play an important role – because they are a source of talent, investment, market opportunities, and entrepreneurial creativity."
金融系统变得更为集中，导致银行问题进一步恶化 — — 它们不仅规模太大，关联和联系太紧密以致无法任由其破产，而且更加难以管理和对公众负责。,"The financial system has become even more concentrated, exacerbating the problem of banks that are not only too big, too interconnected, and too correlated to fail, but that are also too big to manage and be held accountable.","Financial systems became more concentrated, leading to further deterioration in banking problems – not only because they were too big to fail, but also because they were so interconnected and interdependent that they could not be allowed to fail."
在2014年的新兴市场，仅有约55%的成年人开立了银行或金融服务账户，却有近80%的成年人拥有移动电话。,"In emerging markets in 2014, only about 55% of adults had a bank or financial-services account, but nearly 80% had a mobile phone.","In emerging markets in 2014, only about 55% of adults had a bank or financial-services account, but nearly 80% had a mobile phone."
在这个快速变化的时代，教育和技能培训应当与贸易和产业等政策相协调，这样才能更有机会满足新兴的劳动力市场需求。,"At a time of rapid change, education and skills training should be coordinated with, say, trade and industrial policies to improve the chances that emerging labor-market requirements will be met.","In an era of rapid change, education and skills training should be coordinated with trade and industrial policies, in order to better meet emerging labor-market needs."
美国的产出增长依然相当低迷，美国经济依然面临三大赤字：就业赤字、投资赤字和长期财政赤字，这三大赤字都不可能在选举年得到解决。,"Output growth in the US remains anemic, and the economy continues to face three significant deficits: a jobs deficit, an investment deficit, and a long-run fiscal deficit, none of which is likely to be addressed in an election year.","US output growth remains anemic, and the US economy faces three deficits: a jobs deficit, an investment deficit, and a long-term fiscal deficit that cannot be addressed in an election year."
它还有可能改变经济，让欧洲中央银行在下一次欧元危机中无可作为：欧洲央行总是能够击退市场投机，但对来自选民的解体压力毫无反抗之力。,"It will also transform economics, by paralyzing the European Central Bank in the next euro crisis: while the ECB can always defeat market speculation, it is powerless against breakup pressures from voters.","It could also change the economy, making the European Central Bank impotent in the next euro crisis: the ECB can always fend off market speculators, but it is powerless against the disintegration pressures coming from voters."
面对这些可能性，意大利人 — — 正如2015年的希腊人 — — 可能会选择忍气吞声留在欧元区内，但他们也可能会决定冒险搏一把。,"Faced with these possibilities, Italians – like the Greeks in 2015 – might blink and stay. But they also might decide to close their eyes and take the plunge.","Faced with these possibilities, Italians, like the Greeks in 2015, might choose to stay in the eurozone, but they might also decide to take a risk and leave."
这表明，尽管释放囚犯可以促成短期协议，但并没有带来旨在形成基于信任的、能带来持续和平的协议的真正努力。,"This suggests that, while the prisoner release may lead to a short-term agreement, it is not backed by a genuine effort to develop the kind of trust-based arrangements that are needed for lasting peace.","This suggests that, while the release of prisoners can facilitate a short-term agreement, it does not represent a genuine effort to forge a deal based on trust and aimed at achieving a lasting peace."
在危机发生之前，虽然包括IMF组织的在内，全球进行了多次高层对话，但所取得的成效甚微。 目前，危机已经蔓延到全球范围。,"Prior to the crisis, there was plenty of talk, including high-level meetings brokered by the International Monetary Fund, but only minimal action.","Before the crisis, there were numerous high-level meetings around the world, including at the International Monetary Fund, but little was achieved."
一个显著的例子是国际原子能机构在谈判期间被授权进入可疑设施，而当检查者到达时，遭到了地方军官的横眉冷对、礼送出境。,"This was evident in cases where the International Atomic Energy Agency was granted access to suspected facilities during the negotiations, only to have local commanders turn away its inspectors when they arrived.","A striking example is the IAEA’s authorization to inspect suspect facilities during negotiations, only to be turned away by local officials when inspectors arrived."
六四危机，通过团结党领导层的重新团结以及党和城市人民之间的团结的重新建立，巩固了中国共产党的统治，并加速了目前这一轮中国经济高速发展的势头。,"By reunifying the Party leadership and re-establishing solidarity between the Party and the urban population, the crisis consolidated CCP rule, and accelerated China’s momentum down its current path of rapid economic growth.","The Tiananmen crisis, by re-establishing the Party’s leadership and re-establishing Party-people solidarity, consolidated the CCP’s rule and accelerated the current phase of China’s high-speed economic growth."
实际上，英国南极调查局最近的评估显示，自从20世纪70年代以来，南极上空的温度已经升高了3.6度，变暖速度比迄今为止研究人员所认为的要快得多。,"Indeed, recent assessments by the British Antarctic Survey suggest that temperatures over the Antarctic have increased 3.6 degrees since the early 1970’s, and that warming is taking place far faster than researchers had hitherto believed.","In fact, according to a recent assessment by the British Antarctic Survey, temperatures in the Antarctic sky have risen by 3.6°C since the 1970s, at a faster rate than previously thought."
而在本月初，特朗普表示任何来自朝鲜的威胁“都将遭遇前所未有的怒火与打击 ” ， 对此朝鲜领导人金正恩则以威胁袭击关岛的方式作出回应。,"Earlier this month, when Trump said that any North Korean threat “will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen,” North Korean leader Kim Jong-un responded by threatening to attack Guam.","And, earlier this month, Trump said that any threat from North Korea “will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen,” to which North Korean leader Kim Jong-un responded with a threat to attack Guam."
"特朗普还承诺了8,000—10,000亿美元的基础设施投资计划，该计划要通过债券融资。 他还承诺大幅降低公司税。","Trump has also promised an $800 billion-$1 trillion program of infrastructure investment, to be financed by bonds, as well as a massive corporate-tax cut, both aimed at creating 25 million new jobs and boosting growth.","Trump has also promised an infrastructure investment program of $800-1000 billion, to be financed by bonds, and a large reduction in corporate taxes."
比如，2月底，德国总理默克尔做出了令人惊讶的坚持：欧洲不需要加固其金融防火墙来保护其他欧元区国家免受希腊的无序违约。,"At the end of February, for example, German Chancellor Angela Merkel made a spectacle insisting that no bigger financial firewall was needed to protect other eurozone countries from a disorderly Greek default.","For example, at the end of February, German Chancellor Angela Merkel made an astonishing statement: Europe did not need to strengthen its financial firewall to protect other eurozone countries from Greece’s chaotic default."
赋予公民言论自由、独立自由选举权和集会自由的法案至关重要，必须让公众明白没有人能凌驾于法律之上，否则转型就有可能遭到破坏。,"Legislation that empowers citizens with freedom of expression, free and independent elections, and freedom of association is crucial, and it must be made clear to the public that no one is above the law. Anything less will undermine the transition.","Laws that grant citizens freedom of speech, independent electoral rights, and the right to assembly are essential, and must be made clear to the public, lest the transition be undermined."
如果全球经济环境不是如此严峻，就连曾经发誓再也不向国际货币基金组织借款的国家，都恭敬地来到它的门前，那么，这样的伪善就是非常可笑的。,"Such hypocrisy would be laughable if global economic conditions weren’t so dire that even countries that once swore never again to deal with the IMF have returned to its door, cap in hand.",Such hypocrisy would be laughable if the global economic environment were not so grim.
以美国为首的北约在1999年对塞尔维亚的轰炸便未受到国际法的认可，并且是在塞尔维亚盟国俄罗斯的强烈反对下发生的。,"The US-led NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999 lacked the sanction of international law, and occurred despite the strong objections of Russia, a Serbian ally.","NATO’s bombing of Serbia in 1999, led by the US, was not sanctioned by international law, and took place in the face of strong opposition from Serbia’s ally, Russia."
毕竟，美国颠覆过，或者至少试图颠覆过它所反对的无核政权，包括阿富汗、伊拉克、利比亚和（未获成功的）叙利亚。,"The US has, after all, overthrown or at least tried to overthrow non-nuclear regimes that it opposes, including in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and (unsuccessfully) Syria.","After all, the US overthrew, or at least attempted to overthrow, non-nuclear regimes that it opposed, including Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and (unsuccessfully) Syria."
消费者在购买住房和汽车上紧缩开支，不仅仅是因为他们遭受了股票价格的下跌和房屋价值的下降对他们财富的冲击，也因为他们无所适从。,"Consumers are pulling back from home and automobile purchases not only because they have suffered a blow to their wealth with declining stock prices and housing values, but also because they don’t know where to turn.","Consumers are cutting back on purchases of homes and cars not only because they have been hit in the pocketbook by falling stock prices and declining house prices, but also because they don’t feel like it."
中国2004年全国人民代表大会将个体户、私营企业主重新定义为“社会主义事业建设者 ” ， 并把他们包括进爱国统一战线。,"In China, the National People’s Congress in 2004 re-defined entrepreneurs and individual proprietors as “builders of the socialist cause,” and included them in the Patriotic United Front.","In 2004, China’s National People’s Congress redefined individual households and private enterprise owners as “builders of socialism,” and included them in the patriotic united front."
当罗伯特·舒曼和康拉德·阿登纳创立欧洲煤钢共同体的时候，决定性的法国领导开始实现欧洲统一的第一个历史时刻来临了。,The first moment when decisive French leadership began to unify Europe came when Robert Schuman and Konrad Adenauer created the European Coal and Steel Community.,"When Robert Schuman and Konrad Adenauer created the European Coal and Steel Community, a decisive moment in the history of European integration began."
关键不在于桑托勒姆的言论在事实上的对错，而是他所说的能使其追随者们“感觉”良好—因为这符合他们的偏见。,"The point is not whether Santorum is right or wrong factually. What he says “feels” right to his followers, because it conforms to their prejudices.","The key is not that Santorum is factually wrong, but that what he says makes his followers “feel good” – because it confirms their biases."
这在1997-1998年的亚洲金融危机、2008年的全球金融危机和2010年的欧元区危机中都得到印证。,"This pattern was evident in the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis, the 2008 global financial crisis, and the eurozone crisis that erupted in 2010.","This happened during the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998, the global financial crisis of 2008, and the eurozone crisis of 2010."
贫穷的农民可能没钱在这上面投资，或者没有这样做的动机－如果水能直接从公开的来源获得或者如果政府对这种水的使用提供补助。,"Poor farmers may lack the capital to invest in it, or may lack the incentive to do so if water is taken directly from publicly available sources or if the government is subsidizing its use.","Poor farmers may not have the money to invest, or the incentive to do so – if water is available from public sources or if the government subsidizes its use."
正如中国的工业化是前所未有的 — — 没有哪个发展中国家可以在整整二十年的时间里不间断地保持每年10%以上的增长，200年前英国的工业化也是前无古人。,Just as Chinese industrialization is unprecedented – no developing country has grown by more than 10% per year without interruption for two full decades – Britain’s industrialization 200 years ago was similarly unparalleled.,As China’s industrialization was unprecedented – no developing country has ever sustained annual growth of more than 10% for two decades – so was Britain’s industrialization 200 years ago.
最大的金砖经济体中国也陷入了结构性减速，其经济增长率在未来两年中将向5%靠拢（目前为7%以上 ） 。,"The biggest, China, is in the midst of a structural slowdown that will push its growth rate closer to 5% in the next two years, from above 7% now.","China, the largest BRIC economy, is also experiencing a structural slowdown, with its growth rate set to stabilize at around 5% over the next two years (up from more than 7%)."
此外，在20世纪90年代在IMF以及2008—2009全球金融危机中在以色列央行任职期间，费希尔积累了丰富的危机管理经验。,"Moreover, Fischer gained extensive crisis-management experience during his tenure at the IMF in the 1990’s and as Israel’s central banker during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis.","Moreover, during his tenure at the IMF in the 1990’s and at the Bank of Israel during the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, Fischer accumulated a wealth of crisis-management experience."
最近，哈佛大学心理学家史蒂文·平克（Steven Pinker）出版了一本书，记录了各项福利的长期积极趋势，他称之为“启蒙的成果 ” 。,"Recently, the Harvard University psychologist Steven Pinker published a book documenting long-term positive trends in multiple dimensions of wellbeing, which he calls “the fruits of the Enlightenment.”","Recently, Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker published a book, The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined, documenting the long-term positive trend in human welfare."
俄罗斯天然气工业公司的产量正以令人震惊的速度下滑；在国内，那些只依靠一种产业存活的“单一城镇”正在衰亡。,Gazprom’s production is falling at a dizzying pace; the country’s single-industry “mono-towns” are dying.,Gazprom’s production is plummeting at an alarming rate; “single-industry towns” in Russia are dying out.
终止救援就会影响到8000万人民的生活，造成该国地区的不稳定，引发埃塞俄比亚和邻国索马里和厄立特里亚新一轮的冲突。,"Cutting off aid could have calamitous humanitarian consequences for the nation’s 80 million people. It could also destabilize a fragile region, sparking fresh wars with neighboring Somalia and Eritrea.","Cutting off aid would affect the lives of 80 million people, destabilize the region, and trigger a new round of conflict in Ethiopia, Somalia, and Eritrea."
2008年为数不多的积极结果之一是G-20全球影响力的加强；理论上，G-20是远比G-7代表性更强的国际领导力论坛。,"One of the few positive consequences of the 2008 financial crisis was the elevation of the G-20's global role; in principle, it is a far more representative forum for international leadership than the G-7 ever was.","One of the few positive outcomes of 2008 was the strengthening of the G-20’s global influence; theoretically, the G-20 is a more representative international leadership forum than the G-7."
他们联合起来反对像世界贸易组织（WTO）这样的多边机构，世贸组织是拥有准司法争端解决机制的唯一国际机构，也是谈判和执行全球贸易规则的主要论坛。,They rally against multilateral bodies like the World Trade Organization (WTO) – the main forum for negotiating and implementing global trade norms and one of the only international organizations with a quasi-judicial dispute-settlement entity.,"Together, they oppose multilateral institutions like the World Trade Organization (WTO), the only international body with a quasi-judicial dispute-resolution mechanism, and the main forum for negotiating and implementing global trade rules."
尽管普京并未明言猎犬的优劣代表了俄美两国的实力，但上述评论却与他所传递的总体信息如出一辙：永远也不要胆敢质疑我们的力量。,"Though Putin barely implied that the dog’s superiority indicates Russia’s domination over the US, his remark appears to be in line with his general message: don’t you ever dare to doubt our high status.","While Putin did not explicitly equate the hunt with Russia’s power vis-à-vis the US, such commentary was consistent with the overall message he was conveying: Don’t ever doubt our strength."
不断繁荣的中国不仅增加了从其他国家的进口，而且，尽管近年来石油价格大幅度上升，它还提供了保持西方低物价的产品。,"An increasingly prosperous China has not only expanded imports from other countries, but is also providing goods that have kept prices lower in the West, despite sharply higher oil prices in recent years.","Booming China has not only increased imports from other countries, but, despite the recent surge in oil prices, it has also provided the West with products that keep prices low."
但在这个西方国家走向孤立主义的时代 — — 以英国的脱欧公投和美国人选举特朗普为美国总统为标志 — — 区域内的贸易和投资会比以往任何时候都更重要。,"But, at a time when Western countries are moving toward isolationism – exemplified by the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom and the election of Donald Trump as US president – intra-regional trade and investment are more important than ever.",But in an age of Western isolationism – symbolized by the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom and the election of Donald Trump as US President – regional trade and investment are more important than ever.
1996年的特别重大杀戮事件后，新任总理霍华德（John Howard）宣布，够了已经够了（enough was enough ） 。,"After a particularly horrible massacre in 1996, a new prime minister, John Howard, declared that enough was enough.","After the 1996 massacre, the new prime minister, John Howard, declared “enough is enough.”"
不仅如此，梅休并没有发现表明衍生品市场在基础现金市场中造成波动的证据，而事实情况却恰恰相反，衍生品市场能够对基础现金市场的波动起到缓解作用。,"Moreover, he found that there is no evidence that derivative markets create volatility in underlying cash markets; in fact, they may even reduce it.","Moreover, Merton did not find evidence that the derivatives market caused volatility in the cash market, but rather that the derivatives market dampened volatility in the cash market."
这是一个坚实的开端，而且我们应当鼓励发展此类合同以便帮助数以十亿计的人们防范通货膨胀和通货紧缩风险。,"This is a real beginning, and we should encourage such contracts to grow in order to help billions of people hedge their inflation and deflation risks.","This is a strong start, and we should encourage the development of such contracts to help billions of people protect themselves against the risks of inflation and deflation."
坎布里奇—本月，欧盟将迎来其创始条约 — — 罗马条约签订60周年。 罗马条约建立了欧洲经济共同体。,"CAMBRIDGE – This month the European Union will celebrate the 60th anniversary of its founding treaty, the Treaty of Rome, which established the European Economic Community.","CAMBRIDGE – This month, the European Union celebrates the 60th anniversary of its founding treaty, the Treaty of Rome, which established the European Economic Community."
如果随着外交倡议的进展，美国继续采取旁观态度，只在幕后参与讨论并最终任由欧洲为所欲为的话，那么欧洲没有足够的实力采取进一步的行动。,"It is not enough for the Europeans to act while the Americans continue to look on as the diplomatic initiatives unfold, partaking in discussion only behind the scenes and ultimately letting the Europeans do what they will.","If, as the diplomatic initiative progresses, the US continues to adopt a passive stance, participating only behind the scenes and ultimately allowing Europe to do as it pleases, Europe lacks the power to take further action."
2015到2016年间，奥尔班政府斥资超过5，000亿欧元（合5，900亿美元）投入反移民广告，其中包括设立广告牌警告移民不要抢夺本地人的工作。,"Between 2015 and 2016, his government spent more than €50 million ($59 million) on anti-immigrant advertisements, including billboards warning immigrants not to take natives’ jobs.","Between 2015 and 2016, the Orbán government spent more than €50 billion ($590 billion) on anti-immigrant advertising, including billboards warning migrants not to take jobs from locals."
正如萨默斯所警告的，坚持这样做只能在不可避免的失败前造成“不必要的痛苦 ” ， 让希腊（其实远不止希腊）崩溃。,"Staying the course, as Summers warns, will lead only to “needless suffering” before that course inevitably collapses, bringing Greece – and much else –­ crashing down.","As Summers warned, adhering to this approach would cause “unnecessary suffering” before inevitable failure, leading to the collapse of Greece (and much more)."
在这方面，中国和沙特阿拉伯堪称杰出 — — 尽管它们绝不是“孤家寡人 ” — —组织了一系列日益厚颜无耻的绑架或让批评者失踪。,"Here, China and Saudi Arabia stand out – though they are by no means alone – for orchestrating a series of increasingly brazen abductions or vanishings of their detractors.","In this regard, China and Saudi Arabia stand out – though not as “rogue states” – for their increasingly brazen abductions or disappearances of critics."
更广泛地说，保持军事扩张得到监督、扩大武器贸易条约（Arms Trade Treaty）参与国、改善国防当局间的互相谅解现已成为亚洲所面临的重大问题。,"More broadly, keeping military expansion in check, enlarging the number of countries that conclude the Arms Trade Treaty, and improving mutual understanding among national defense authorities are now the paramount issues facing Asia.","More broadly, keeping military expansion in check, expanding participation in the Arms Trade Treaty, and improving inter-agency cooperation on defense issues have become major challenges for Asia."
直到最近，普京与贝隆夫人的相似之处还不那么明显（尽管定期的肉毒杆菌抗皱纹治疗让前者看上去像经过防腐处理的后者 ） 。,"Until recently, Putin’s resemblance to Evita was not so obvious (though his regular Botox treatments have given him the look that she took on after she was embalmed).","Until recently, the resemblance between Putin and Merkel was not so obvious (although regular Botox injections made the former look like the latter had been preserved in formaldehyde)."
在当前环境中，地缘政治紧张升级、信任缺失以及对关键性机构的不尊重所形成的累积效应可能带来一次重大冲击，也有可能只是令投资条件出现恶化。,"In the current context, the cumulative effect of rising geopolitical tensions, loss of trust, and disrespect for key institutions could produce either a large shock or just deteriorating conditions for investment.","In the current environment, the accumulation of geopolitical tensions, trust deficits, and disrespect for key institutions could lead to a major shock, or merely to deteriorating investment conditions."
东京—10月5日，在经历了多年令人心疲力竭、事无巨细的讨价还价后，12个环太平洋国家终于签署了跨太平洋合作伙伴关系（TPP ） 。 TPP协定包括了从更多贸易到更清洁的环境的一系列承诺。,"TOKYO – On October 5, after years of exhausting – and exhaustive – haggling, a dozen Pacific Rim countries finally signed up to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), an agreement that promises everything from more trade to a cleaner environment.","TOKYO – On October 5, after years of arduous negotiations, 12 Pacific Rim countries finally signed the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement, which includes commitments ranging from more trade to a cleaner environment."
在多边主义的框架下，各国必须通力合作，减少分歧并深化关系，因此我们必须克服的，就是那种将我们引向旧思维 — — 和旧联盟 — — 的惰性。,"Within the framework of multilateralism, countries must make the effort to smooth over their differences and deepen their relations: we must conquer the inertia that moves us towards old thinking – and old alliances.","Within the framework of multilateralism, countries must cooperate, reduce their differences, and deepen their relationships, so we must overcome the inertia that leads us back to old ways of thinking – and old alliances."
而现在，因为确认巨额援助资金被盗，这种悲伤的情绪又掺杂了愤怒和失望 — — 这样的不满既针对欺诈行为本身，也针对这件事所体现出来的非洲改善医疗机会和成果的斗争现状。,"And now, with confirmation that huge sums of aid were stolen, the grief is compounded by anger and disappointment – at the fraud itself, but also for what it says about Africa’s struggles to improve health-care access and outcomes.","Now, with confirmation that the money was stolen, there is a mixture of sadness, anger, and frustration – not only at the fraud itself, but also at the struggle to improve health opportunities and outcomes in Africa."
倘若五月初玛琳·勒庞得胜，欧盟就将终结，只留下德国总理默克尔（Angela Merkel）苦苦支撑一个行将崩溃的世界秩序。,"A victory for Le Pen in early May would spell the end of the EU, leaving German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the final pillar of a crumbling world order.","If Marine Le Pen wins in May, the EU will end, leaving German Chancellor Angela Merkel to hold together a world order that is collapsing."
如果土耳其成为欧盟成员国，那么欧洲从经济和军事上都能得到加强，而如果土耳其满足了包括言论自由在内的政治标准，那么它应该获得和其他成员国一致的准入谈判。,"Europe would strengthen itself economically and militarily if Turkey became a member, and it should revive accession negotiations on the same basis as other member states if Turkey meets the political criteria, including press freedom.","If Turkey becomes a member of the EU, Europe will be stronger economically and militarily, and if Turkey meets the political criteria, including freedom of expression, it should be accorded the same accession negotiations as other member states."
发自牛津 — — 联合国正在甄选下一任秘书长，世界银行行长的职位正虚位以待，而世界卫生组织也在物色一位新带头人，其他一些国际组织也面临着类似的状况。,OXFORD – The United Nations is seeking a new secretary-general. The World Bank presidency is up for grabs.,"OXFORD – The United Nations is in the process of selecting a new secretary-general, the World Bank is without a president, and the World Health Organization is looking for a new leader."
此外王储萨勒曼尽管有诸多缺点，但依然算是个改革者，知道自己国家的繁荣和王室的生存离不开开放和多元化。,"Moreover, MBS, for all his faults, is something of a reformer, understanding that his country must open up and diversify if it is to thrive and the royal family is to survive.","Moreover, Prince Salman, despite his many flaws, is a reformer who knows that his country’s prosperity and the monarchy’s survival depend on openness and diversity."
毕竟 ， “ 鱼鹰”的安全风险相对于朝鲜导弹或中国侵犯该地区（尤其是附近的钓鱼岛）的所引发的安全威胁来说简直是微不足道的。,"After all, the Osprey’s safety risks are insignificant relative to the security threat posed by, say, a North Korean missile or Chinese aggression in the area, especially the nearby Senkaku Islands.","After all, the security risk posed by the “Fish Eagle” is minuscule compared to the security threat posed by North Korean missiles or Chinese aggression in the region (and particularly in the Senkaku Islands)."
"处于同一状态的保守党政客如果了解一下已经导致了3,600多起暴力死亡的“爱尔兰问题 ” ， 将大有裨益。","Conservative politicians who find themselves in such a position would do well to know that conflicts over the “Irish question” have resulted in more than 3,600 violent deaths.","Conservative politicians in the same position would do well to understand the “Irish problem” that has led to more than 3,600 violent deaths."
"自去年12月黄热病病毒在安哥拉首都兼最大城市罗安达现身以来，已经夺走293人的生命，疑似传染病例2,267人。","Since the virus emerged in Luanda, Angola’s capital and most populous city, last December, it has killed 293 people and infected a suspected 2,267.","Since the Ebola virus appeared in the Angolan capital and largest city, Luanda, last December, it has claimed 293 lives and infected 2,267 people."
我再次谴责了他们的袭击行为，并且敦促他们宣布单边停火或者与以色列共同达成协议在相当长的一段时间内停止加沙内外的所有军事行动。,"I made the same condemnation to them, and urged that they declare a unilateral ceasefire or orchestrate with Israel a mutual agreement to terminate all military action in and around Gaza for an extended period.","I again condemned their attacks, and urged them to declare a unilateral ceasefire or enter into an agreement with Israel to stop all military operations in Gaza and elsewhere for an extended period."
当年林登·约翰逊（Lyndon Johnson）总统决定升级美国对越南的干预时，就引用了慕尼黑的例子 — — 后者因坐视希特勒的恶行而导致了灾难性的后果。,"President Lyndon Johnson, when deciding to escalate US intervention in Vietnam, drew an analogy with Munich, when the failure to respond to Hitler’s aggression had catastrophic consequences.","When President Lyndon Johnson decided to escalate US involvement in Vietnam in 1965, he cited the example of Munich – where inaction in the face of Hitler’s aggression led to catastrophic consequences."
第一个选择就是通过最低工资法律或者支付社会安置收入来维护低技能者的收入，这就意味着要求私营部门支付最低工资。,The first option is to defend the wages of the low skilled through minimum-wage laws or paying social replacement incomes which imply minimum wage demands against the private economy.,"The first option is to maintain low-skilled workers’ incomes through minimum-wage laws or social-security payments, which means requiring the private sector to pay the minimum wage."
其中一些经济学家虽然认识到当前紧张局势会增加政策意外或错误的风险，但将其视为摆明姿态和谈判的一部分。,"For example, one group, while recognizing that the current tensions increase the risk of a policy accident or mistake, views them as part of a process of posturing and negotiation.","Some economists recognize that the current tense situation increases the risk of policy surprises or mistakes, but view it as part of posturing and negotiations."
第一个假设是贸易的收益天然能够被大部分人所分享，或者直接得到，或者通过增长加快的经济体的合理再分配政策获得。,"The first assumption was that the benefits of trade would naturally be shared by most of the population, either directly or because of appropriate redistribution policies implemented in the now-faster growing economies.","The first assumption is that the benefits of trade are naturally shared by most people, either directly or through a reasonable redistributive policy in an economy that grows faster."
此外目前美国玉米产量的40%都已经用作提炼乙醇，而几年前这一比例还仅有5%左右，这意味着玉米价格必须提高以应对市场对食品，出口和乙醇生产的需求。,"In addition, the fact that nearly 40% of the US corn crop is being used for ethanol, up from around 5% a few years ago, means that corn prices must be higher to meet the feed, export, and ethanol demands for corn.","Moreover, 40% of US corn production is now used to produce ethanol, up from 5% a few years ago, meaning that corn prices must rise to meet market demand for food, exports, and ethanol production."
相对1995—2007年趋势的累计产出损失，目前美国为GDP的78 % ， 欧元区为GDP的60 % 。,"Cumulative output losses relative to the 1995-2007 trends now stand at 78% of annual GDP for the US, and at 60% for the eurozone.","Relative to the 1995-2007 trend, cumulative output losses amount to 78% of GDP in the United States and 60% in the eurozone."
但如果油田的所有者们认为油价在长期来看会呈下跌之势，他们现在便会有动力开发石油并扩大生产以求在跌价之前卖出更多的石油。,"But if owners of oil reserves think that prices will fall in the long run, they gain an incentive to explore for oil and expand production now in order to sell as much oil as possible before the fall.","But if the owners of the oil fields believe that the price of oil is likely to fall in the long run, they now have an incentive to develop the oil and expand production in order to sell more oil before the price falls."
在与哈梅内伊的相对地位上，拉夫桑贾尼比其后的所有总统都更加强势，因为当时哈梅内伊刚刚被选为最高领袖霍梅尼的继任者。,"Rafsanjani was in a much stronger position vis-à-vis Khamenei, who had just been selected to succeed Khomeini as Supreme Leader, than any of Iran’s subsequent presidents.","Relative to Khamenei, Rafsanjani was more powerful than any of his successors, because Khamenei had just been chosen as the successor to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic."
马克思将一切社会矛盾都处理为阶级斗争，而阶级斗争会随着私有财产的消失而消失，因此，共产主义成立后不可能再有异见。,"Because Marxism treats all contradictions in society as the products of a class struggle that will disappear when private property does, dissent after the establishment of communism is impossible.","Marx treated all social contradictions as class struggles, which would disappear with the disappearance of private property, so there could be no disagreement after the establishment of communism."
在习近平取消主席任期制时，大家都认为他在中共党内的统治地位几乎是无可置疑的，因此他的权威也不可能受到挑战。,"At the time of Xi’s announcement, the conventional wisdom was that his dominance inside the Chinese party-state was virtually absolute, and thus that his authority could not possibly come under attack.","When Xi abolished term limits for the presidency, it was widely assumed that his dominance within the party was unassailable, so his authority was unlikely to be challenged."
但它们都不能不关注一个重要目标：制定一个新政策框架，这个框架要基于存在的共同利益，能够阻止关系的恶化、稳定欧洲-大西洋安全。,"But none should distract attention from the important goal of identifying a new policy framework, based on existential common interests, that can stop the downward spiral in relations and stabilize Euro-Atlantic security.",But they should all be mindful of an important goal: developing a new policy framework that is based on existing common interests and can prevent the deterioration of relations and stabilize European-Atlantic security.
但是，由于俄国继续坚持其在九十年代早期做出的国策，也就是向西方开放，因此所有这些都并不构成俄国战略上的根本性变化。,"Yet none of this amounts to a fundamental change in Russia’s strategy, because Russia continues to adhere to its fundamental decision, made in the early 1990’s, to open itself to the West.","But, because Russia has continued to pursue the policy of openness to the West that it adopted in the early 1990’s, none of this constitutes a fundamental change in Russia’s strategic orientation."
虽然俄罗斯前途未谱，但它的历史变得更加清晰，部分原因是因为我们现在知道苏共20大开启了苏联专制的终结。,"Although Russia’s future is uncertain, its history is becoming clearer, in part because we now know that the Twentieth Party Congress started the process that brought about the end of Soviet despotism.","While Russia’s future is uncertain, its history is becoming clearer, in part because we now know that the 20th Party Congress marked the end of the Soviet regime."
中国部署了数万名“网警 ” ， 以封锁网站、在网吧中进行巡查、监控移动电话的使用、并追踪互联网上的活跃人士。,"China deploys tens of thousands of “ cyber police” to block Web sites, patrol cyber-cafes, monitor the use of cellular telephones, and track down Internet activists.","China has deployed thousands of “netizens” to block websites, patrol Internet cafes, monitor mobile-phone use, and track Internet users."
简而言之，汹涌流向美国的资本人为地压低了利率并抬高了资产价格，导致银行和监管标准松懈并且最终造成瓦解。,"Simply put, surging capital flows into the US artificially held down interest rates and inflated asset prices, leading to laxity in banking and regulatory standards and, ultimately, to a meltdown.","In short, the flood of capital into the US depressed interest rates and pushed up asset prices, leading to lax banking and regulatory standards and ultimately to a breakdown."
就在一个月前，南亚发生海啸，有关人员死亡、灾民受难以及各种基础设施遭受严重破坏的报道占据了此次海啸报道的主题。,"Reports about the tsunamis that devastated Southeast Asia barely a month ago have understandably been dominated by tales of death, suffering, and the physical destruction of infrastructure.","Just a month ago, a tsunami struck South Asia, killing thousands, displacing millions, and causing widespread damage to infrastructure."
"成功需要每年投入6,000亿美元，涉及到的领域包括环境修复和保护、可再生能源和能源效率，以及可持续交通系统。","Success will require an estimated $600 billion in investment each year, in areas including environmental remediation and protection, renewable energies and energy efficiency, and sustainable transportation systems.","Success would require an annual investment of $600 billion, encompassing areas such as environmental restoration and protection, renewable energy and energy efficiency, and sustainable transportation systems."
但我们认为新公约所规定的、正被各成员国越来越多地使用的有效多数票（qualified majority voting）方式，也应该适用于公约的批准过程本身。,"We believe, though, that the increased use of qualified majority voting by member governments embodied in the new treaty should also be applied to the ratification process itself.","But we believe that the new treaty’s provision for effective majority voting, which is increasingly being used by member states, should also apply to the treaty’s own ratification process."
诚然，巴西仍旧是一个“硬”左派国家。 譬如，卢拉党内的一些人还支持古巴的卡斯特罗兄弟和委内瑞拉总统乌戈 查韦斯。,"True, Brazil still has a “hard” left, and some in Lula’s own party are comfortable with, say, Cuba’s Castro brothers and Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez.","To be sure, Brazil is still a “hard” left-wing country, as some members of the PT still support Fidel and Raúl Castro and Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez."
在布雷顿森林体系崩溃后的十年里，IMF重新化身为1970年代石油价格震荡所带来的储备盈余的首要管理机构。,"In the years after the collapse of Bretton Woods, the IMF reinvented itself as a principle vehicle for managing the surpluses that followed the oil price shocks of the 1970’s.","In the decade following the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, the IMF re-emerged as the primary manager of the reserve surpluses generated by the oil price shocks of the 1970’s."
在2008年8月份向格鲁吉亚派出军队后，俄罗斯承认了两个从格鲁吉亚脱离的省份南奥塞梯（South Ossetia）和阿布哈兹（Abkhazia）的独立。,"After Russia sent troops into Georgia in August 2008, it recognized the independence of two breakaway Georgian provinces, South Ossetia and Abkhazia.","After sending troops to Georgia in August 2008, Russia recognized the independence of the two Georgian provinces that had seceded, South Ossetia and Abkhazia."
这导致理论界陷入困境：这些政权并非主要依靠硬实力，也没有成功建立起软实力，但仍然能在国外发挥真实的影响。,"Theorists are therefore in a bind: these regimes are not relying chiefly on hard power, are unsuccessful at generating soft power, but are still able to project real influence abroad.","This has left theorists in a quandary: these regimes are not primarily based on hard power, nor have they succeeded in building soft power, but they still exert real influence abroad."
伊萨卡—步入2012年之际，我们值得思考一下新兴市场的十年强劲经济增长是如何引发去年波涛汹涌的政治转型的。,"ITHACA – With 2012 underway, it is worth reflecting on how a decade of strong economic growth in emerging markets led to last year’s resounding political transformations.","ISLAMABAD – As we approach 2012, it is worth reflecting on how the decade of strong economic growth in emerging markets triggered last year’s political upheavals."
但是，更有可能的是，在经历了多年的缓慢复苏后，美国经济也许终于已经准备好大步向前了，至少可以维持一段时间。,"Still, it is far more likely that after years of slow recovery, the US economy might at last be ready to move significantly faster, at least for a while.","But, more likely, after years of slow recovery, the US economy may finally be ready to move forward, at least for a while."
如此，特朗普就能在国内宣称取得胜利，同时让欧洲消费者摆脱欧盟农业保护主义的束缚，提高欧洲人民的生活水平。,"This would enable Trump to proclaim victory at home, while raising the European standard of living by freeing Europe’s consumers from the yoke of the EU’s agricultural protectionism.","That way, Trump could claim victory at home, while liberating European consumers from the EU’s agricultural protectionism and raising European living standards."
而她的政府要求债务国通过极端紧缩和痛苦的调整来应对金融恐慌，哪怕与此同时德国的经常账户盈余是不断膨胀的。,"And her governments responded to financial panic by demanding extreme austerity and painful adjustments in debtor countries, even as Germany’s current-account surplus swelled.","Her government demanded that debtor countries respond to the financial panic with extreme austerity and painful adjustment, even as Germany’s current-account surplus continued to grow."
中国人大常委会罕见地介入“说明”基本法第104条，宣布所有官员就职宣誓必须“准确、完整、庄重、真诚 ” 。,"In an extraordinary move, China’s National People’s Congress Standing Committee stepped in to “clarify” Article 104 of the Basic Law, declaring that all oaths taken by office-holders must be “solemn, accurate, complete, and sincere.”","China’s top legislative body, the National People’s Congress, has rarely intervened in the drafting of the Constitution, but it did so in 2013, when it declared that all officials must take an oath that is “accurate, complete, solemn, and sincere.”"
经合组织2016年按任务对职业进行分解的研究表明，在21个经合组织国家中仅有9%的工作岗位确实处在危险之中。,"According to a 2016 OECD study that breaks down occupations by task, only 9% of jobs on average across 21 OECD countries are really at risk.",The OECD’s 2016 Job Decomposition by Task study found that only 9% of jobs in 21 OECD countries are truly at risk.
一场更大规模的贸易战将会对美国制造和农业企业产生巨大的负面影响，而现在看来这种贸易战爆发的几率越来越高。,"A larger-scale trade war (or wars), with a significant negative impact on US manufacturing and agriculture, appears ever more likely.","A larger-scale trade war would have devastating consequences for US manufacturing and agricultural firms, and the likelihood of such a war is increasing."
每个人都有不同的看法，我将提供我自己的2012中东综述，并给出2013年的建议，如果我们想让损失少些的话。,"While there have been many prescriptions, I will provide my own 2012 Middle East roundup, with a look toward what must happen in 2013 if we want it to bring fewer losses.","I will offer my own 2012 Middle East overview, with recommendations for 2013, if we want to minimize the losses."
《纽约时报》和《华盛顿邮报》上的报道与直接面向千百万人、在党派电台和电视节目上反复播出的总统的推特比起来根本没有那么重要了。,What appears in The New York Times or the Washington Post matters less than presidential tweets that go straight to millions of people and are echoed in partisan radio or TV shows.,"Coverage in the New York Times and the Washington Post pales in comparison to the president’s tweets, which are broadcast directly to millions of people on party-affiliated radio and television programs."
"Pourtant, aujourd’hui, les universités des États-Unis sont bien meilleures que leurs homologues européennes.","Yet today, universities in the United States easily outperform their European counterparts.","Yet, today, American universities are better than their European counterparts."
随着中国从储蓄剩余转向吸收储蓄 — — 利用其剩余储蓄为中国人构建安全网，而不是补贴美国人的储蓄 — — 储蓄不足的美国将发现难以填补空白。,As China shifts from surplus saving to saving absorption – using its surpluses to build a safety net for the Chinese people rather than subsidize the savings of Americans – a saving-short US will find it tough to fill the void.,"As China moves from saving surpluses to absorbing them – using its remaining surpluses to build a safety net for its own citizens, rather than subsidizing those of the US – the US will find it difficult to fill the gap."
当然，伊斯兰教武装有其自身的独特性，但领袖肉体消灭和组织生存之间的关系等等重要特点与其他某些武装组织相通。,"Armed Islamism has its particularities, of course, but it also shares important characteristics with some of these groups, including the relationship between the physical elimination of a leader and organizational survival.","Of course, Islamist armed groups have their own distinctive features, but important features such as the relationship between the physical elimination of leaders and the survival of the organization are shared with other armed groups."
这似乎就是我们专注于像《京都议定书》这一类的让自我感觉良好的方式的原因。 它的根本问题从来就是既好高骛远，又不符合环境逻辑，还代价不菲。,"This seems to be why we focus on feel-good approaches like the Kyoto Protocol, whose fundamental problem has always been that it is simultaneously impossibly ambitious, environmentally inconsequential, and inordinately expensive.","This seems to be the reason why we focus on feel-good measures like the Kyoto Protocol. Its fundamental problem has always been that it is too little, too late, and too expensive."
萨科齐总统的外貌及其身体语言 — — 如果他是莎士比亚笔下的一个角色的话，他可能是《奥赛罗》中的反面人物伊阿古 — — 也是问题的一部分。,"The president’s physical appearance and his body language – if he was a Shakespeare character, he would probably be the traitor Iago in Othello – are part of the problem.","President Sarkozy’s appearance and his body language – if he were a Shakespearean character, he might be Iago in Othello – are part of the problem."
除了一小撮顽固的马克思主义分子¾他们目前还把持着10%左右的选票¾人们都清醒地意识到要改变过去10年高失业和低增长的状况，必须要实行较为深入的改革。,Except for a fringe of die-hard Marxists – which can still collect up to 10% of the votes – there is a keen sense that deep reforms are needed to come to grip with the high unemployment and poor growth of the last decade.,"Except for a small group of die-hard Marxists, who currently hold about 10% of the vote, everyone is aware that to change the past decade of high unemployment and low growth, deeper reforms are needed."
在大部分国家，公债占GDP比例自2004年以来从未超过60 % — —与2004年前成为欧盟成员的15个国家中的许多国家形成了鲜明对比。,"In most countries, public debt as a share of GDP has not exceeded 60% since 2004 – in stark contrast to many of the 15 countries that were members of the European Union prior to that year.","In most countries, public debt as a share of GDP has never exceeded 60% since 2004 – a stark contrast to many of the 15 countries that joined the EU before 2004."
随着这些改革措施的推进，印度企业最终应能够恢复支出，银行也将再次能够给至关重要但目前负债沉重的基础设施和制造业部门提供贷款。,"As these reforms take hold, Indian firms should finally be able to resume spending, and banks will once again be able to lend to the critical but currently indebted infrastructure and manufacturing sectors.","As these reforms are implemented, Indian firms should be able to resume spending, and banks will once again be able to lend to vital but currently debt-laden sectors like infrastructure and manufacturing."
西方自由民主国家应该如何面对一个按照自己的战略计划行动、利用它们的开放性推动它的意识形态和地缘政治目标的中国？,"How should Western liberal democracies confront a China that is taking a page from their own playbook, as it exploits their openness to advance its ideological and geopolitical objectives?","How should Western liberal democracies deal with a China that acts according to its own strategic plan, using their openness to advance its ideological and geopolitical objectives?"
如果首相梅的政府在接下来的与欧盟的谈判中聚焦于真正重要的东西，我们可以谨慎乐观地认为能够达成好交易。,"If Prime Minister Theresa May’s government focuses on what really matters in the upcoming negotiations with the EU, we can be guardedly optimistic that it will return with a good deal.","If Prime Minister Theresa May’s government focuses on the really important things in the next round of negotiations with the EU, we can be cautiously optimistic that a good deal can be done."
回到今年四月，二十国集团领袖已经承认投资于低碳的基础设施、特别是能源服务是确保真正可持续经济和环境未来的关键所在。,"Back in April, G-20 leaders accepted that investing in a low-carbon infrastructure, particularly energy services, is key to a truly sustainable economic and environmental future.","Back in April, G-20 leaders recognized that investment in low-carbon infrastructure, especially energy services, is key to ensuring a truly sustainable economic and environmental future."
大多数人需要一个社会定义，但将这一定义依附在一座城市之上显然要比依附在一个全副武装并打算与敌人发生冲突的国家身上更好。,"Most people need a communal identity, but it may well be better to find it in one’s attachment to a city than in attachment to a country that is armed and willing to engage in conflict with enemies.","Most people need a social definition, but it is better to attach it to a city than to a country that is fully armed and ready to fight."
所有重要的事情都是为了取悦他们的企业金主，金主们将用献金来回来这个党派，这些献金将被用来换取选票，从而确保一个由企业驱动的政治议程不断延续下去。,"All that matters is pleasing their corporate sponsors, who will reward the party with contributions, which will be used to buy votes, thereby ensuring the perpetuation of a corporate-driven political agenda.","All important things are done for the benefit of their corporate masters, who in turn finance the party, which in turn buys votes to ensure a corporate-driven political agenda."
美国和欧洲（欧盟各成员国政府以及欧盟本身）是联合国难民高级委员会的最大出资者，但许多其他国家政府不愿意承担公平份额。,"The United States and Europe (both European Union member governments and the EU itself) are the largest contributors to the UN High Commission on Refugees, but many other governments are unwilling to commit their fair share.","The United States and Europe (the governments of the European Union’s member states and the EU itself) are the UNHCR’s largest donors, but many other governments are reluctant to contribute their fair share."
"光是在2月，就有尼日利亚 (1,000百万瓦 ) 、 澳大利亚(2,000百万瓦)和印度(10,000百万瓦)等新项目公布。","In February alone, there were announcements of new solar power projects in Nigeria (1,000 megawatts), Australia (2,000 MW), and India (10,000 MW).","In February alone, new projects were announced in Nigeria (1,000 MW), Australia (2,000 MW) and India (10,000 MW)."
从这一技术官僚观点来看，今天的布鲁塞尔维持了某些功能，而即使在某些民族国家内部，这些功能都经常被分派到不是民主选举产生的机构中。,"From this technocratic perspective, Brussels today maintains functions that even within nation states are often delegated to institutions that are not democratically elected.","From this technocratic perspective, today’s Brussels fulfills some functions, and even within some nation-states, these functions are often delegated to institutions that are not democratically elected."
该技术可以成为消灭许多致命疾病的福音，也可能隐含严重的 — — 并且可能是完全不可预料的 — — 风险。,"While the technology could prove a boon in the fight against many deadly diseases, it also implies serious – and potentially entirely unpredictable – risks.","This technology has the potential to be a boon in the fight against many deadly diseases, but it also carries significant – and possibly unforeseeable – risks."
不同于传统智慧，服务业的日益增长是为了满足国内消费需求，并不意味着制造业和资本投资的末日，更不意味着经济增长走到尽头。,"Contrary to the conventional wisdom, the growth of services in China to meet domestic demand does not mean the end of manufacturing and capital investment, much less of economic growth.","Unlike traditional wisdom, the growing share of services in the economy does not mean the end of manufacturing and capital investment, much less the end of economic growth."
而欧盟则提供这一套共同规则，通过共同的机构，让每一个国家 — — 即使是最小的 — — 都能有发言权。,"The EU provides this set of common rules, buttressed by common institutions that give every country, even the smallest, a say.","And the EU provides a set of common rules, enforced by a common institution, that gives every country – even the smallest – a voice."
巴黎—德国财政部长朔伊布勒最近将希腊退出欧元的选项摆上了台面，他希望释放一个信号，即，任何一个成员国都不能免于货币联盟严格纪律的约束。,"PARIS – When Wolfgang Schäuble, Germany’s finance minister, recently tabled the option of a Greek exit from the euro, he wanted to signal that no member could abstain from the monetary union’s strict disciplines.","PARIS – Germany’s finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, recently put Greece’s exit from the euro on the table, hoping to send a signal that no member state is immune from the strictures of monetary union."
而这也是为什么我们呼吁实施一些额外手段去加强伊朗政治变革的前景，催生一个准备与人民和邻国和平共处的伊朗政府。,This is why additional measures are called for to improve the prospects for political change that brings about an Iranian government prepared to live in peace with its own people and its neighbors.,"That is why we are calling for additional measures to strengthen the prospects for political change in Iran, generating a government that is prepared to live in peace with its people and its neighbors."
具体地讲，我们需要同步推进有利于增长的结构性改革、加强需求管理、解决过度负债问题并改善地区和全球政策框架。,"What is needed, in particular, is simultaneous progress on pro-growth structural reforms, better demand management, addressing pockets of excessive indebtedness, and improving regional and global policy frameworks.","Specifically, we need to synchronize structural reforms that boost growth, strengthen demand management, resolve excessive debt, and improve the regional and global policy framework."
与此同时，危机爆发前所存在的金融不平衡和扭曲让应对实体经济中的技术和全球市场推动力的必要措施推迟了。,"At the same time, the financial imbalances and distortions that precede a crisis delay appropriate and necessary responses to technological and global market forces in the real economy as well.","At the same time, the financial imbalances and distortions that prevailed prior to the crisis delayed necessary measures to address the technological and global-market forces driving the real economy."
但与金大中和卢拉一样，齐普拉斯可以从一些认为“如果他现在说这些措施不可避免，那么确实是别无选择了”的左派中赢得政治支持。,"But like Kim and Lula, Tsipras could marshal political support from some on the left who reckon, “If he now says that these measures are unavoidable, there truly must be no alternative.”","But, like Kim Dae-jung and Lula, Chirac could win political support from some on the left who think, “If he says it’s inevitable, then it must be.”"
对此，我们需要塑造一个能同时对国家政府和民间社会起作用的，崭新的长期政策，这要求我们有足够的耐心和战略持续性。,We are faced with forging a new long-term policy that affects both states and societies. That task requires patience and strategic perseverance.,"To this end, we need a new, long-term policy that works both at the national government level and in civil society, requiring patience and strategic persistence."
从这个角度讲，卡塔尔方针在成员国坐拥世界石油储量近一半的海湾合作委员会（Gulf Cooperation Council）内部造成了罕见的分裂。,"In this sense, Qatar’s tack has produced a rare schism within the Gulf Cooperation Council, whose members collectively possess nearly half of the world’s oil reserves.","From this perspective, Qatar’s approach has caused an unprecedented rift within the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which comprises countries that collectively hold nearly half of the world’s oil reserves."
阿克拉—在最近举行的卢旺达基加利峰会上，44个非洲国家首脑签署了一份新自由贸易协定。 该协定旨在改变地区营商方式。,"ACCRA – At a recent summit in Kigali, Rwanda, 44 African heads of state signed a new free-trade agreement aimed at changing the way the region does business.","AKURE – At a recent summit in Kigali, Rwanda, 44 African heads of state signed a new free-trade agreement aimed at changing the way business is done in the region."
金融危机迫使主权国家用其自身信用来取代破产信用，欧洲也不例外，每个国家必须各扫门前雪，这就使人们对欧洲政府债券的可信度产生了怀疑。,"The financial crisis forced sovereign states to substitute their own credit for the credit that had collapsed, and in Europe each state had to do so on its own, calling into question the creditworthiness of European government bonds.","The financial crisis forced sovereign states to replace bankrupt credit with their own credit, and Europe is no exception, with each country having to fend for itself, which has undermined confidence in European government bonds."
在东中国海和南中国海存在着武装冲突的危险，而朝鲜不顾美国和联合国的更严厉制裁持续研发核武器和弹道导弹。,"There is a risk of armed clashes in the East and South China Seas, and North Korea continues to develop nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, despite tougher sanctions pushed by the United States and the United Nations.","The danger of armed conflict in the East and South China Seas is growing, while North Korea continues to develop nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles in defiance of tougher US and UN sanctions."
在美国，2008年的预算赤字占美国GDP的5.8 % ， 根据同一份OECD预测报告，在2009年会达到GDP的10.2 % ， 这一比例就 变成和德国一样的了，即GDP的4.4 % 。,"In the United States, the budget deficit in 2008 stood at 5.8% of GDP, and, according to the same OECD forecast, will amount to 10.2% of GDP in 2009, which translates into exactly the same economic stimulus as in Germany, 4.4% of GDP.","In the US, the budget deficit reached 5.8% of GDP in 2008, according to the same OECD forecast, and is projected to reach 10.2% of GDP in 2009, which would be the same as Germany’s 4.4%."
随着各国变得日益富裕，非贸易服务构成了产出的更大份额，导致GDP增长快于贸易，同时全球产能过剩进一步遏制了贸易增长。,"As countries become richer, non-traded services constitute a greater share of output, causing GDP to grow faster than trade, while global overcapacity has restrained trade growth further.","As countries became richer, non-traded services accounted for a larger share of output, leading to faster GDP growth than trade, while global excess capacity further constrained trade growth."
讽刺之处在于，尽管美国之所以寻求与印度的更强的防务关系，其目的很大程度上是遏制日益专横的中国，但美国总统奥巴马却在中印争端中采取了中立立场。,"The irony is that, while America’s pursuit of a stronger defense relationship with India is aimed largely at offsetting an increasingly assertive China, US President Barack Obama has charted a neutral course in Sino-Indian disputes.","Ironically, while the US seeks a stronger defense relationship with India in order to contain an increasingly assertive China, US President Barack Obama has taken a neutral stance in the India-China dispute."
毛里求斯选择了一条走向高社会凝聚力，高福利和高速发展的道路 — — 同时也将社会不平等状况维持在较细微的程度。,"Mauritians have chosen a path that leads to higher levels of social cohesion, welfare, and economic growth – and to a lower level of inequality.","Mauritius has chosen a path of high social cohesion, high welfare, and high growth – while maintaining a relatively low level of social inequality."
直到20世纪70年代，人们还普遍认为尽管两国同样面临极端贫困、经济落后和疾病的挑战，但印度的模式要好于中国，因为它的民众可以自由选择统治者。,"Until the 1970s, it was widely argued that, while both countries suffered from extreme poverty, underdevelopment, and disease, India’s model was superior, because its people were free to choose their own rulers.","Until the 1970’s, it was widely believed that, although both countries faced the same challenges of extreme poverty, economic backwardness, and disease, India’s model was better, because its people could freely choose their rulers."
但最终，特朗普的非典型 — — 并且越来越可恶 — — 执政才是更大的全球威胁，他给了普京更多地机会，冒险激进地削弱美国的实力。,"Ultimately, however, it is Trump’s aberrant – and increasingly abhorrent – presidency that poses the bigger global threat, not least by offering Putin more opportunities to engage in adventurism and degrade US power.","But, in the end, Trump’s unconventional – and increasingly malign – presidency poses a greater global threat, giving Putin more opportunities to take risks and aggressively undermine American power."
而最近一条则来自波士顿大学财富与慈善事业研究中心，中心预计美国人将在2010年拿出约2500亿美元的个人慈善捐助，比去年又增长了数十亿美元。,"The newest bit of good news comes from The Center on Wealth and Philanthropy at Boston College, which estimates that Americans will give about $250 billion in individual charitable contributions in 2010, up several billion from last year.","The most recent estimate comes from the Center on Wealth and Philanthropy at Boston College, which projects that Americans will give about $250 billion in personal charitable gifts in 2010, an increase of several billion dollars over last year."
1月15日，瑞士国民银行出人意料地宣布放弃盯住欧元 — — 一个月前它还在重申盯住欧元的承诺 — — 曾经严守纪律的瑞士国民银行已经顾不上时间一致性的信誉要求了。,By unexpectedly abandoning the euro peg on January 15 – just a month after reiterating a commitment to it – the once-disciplined SNB has run roughshod over the credibility requirements of time consistency.,"On January 15, the Swiss National Bank unexpectedly announced that it was abandoning its commitment to defend the euro – a month after reaffirming that commitment – undermining its credibility as a time-consistent institution."
因此，禁止同性恋行为的根本问题不在于国家用法律来实行某种道德观，而在于该法律是建立在认为同性恋不道德的错误观点之上。,"The underlying problem with prohibiting homosexual acts, then, is not that the state is using the law to enforce private morality. It is that the law is based on the mistaken view that homosexuality is immoral.","Thus, the fundamental problem with banning homosexuality is not that the state is imposing a particular moral view, but that it is doing so on the basis of an erroneous view that homosexuality is immoral."
在过去60年中只有少数几个国家完全赶上的发达国家的生活水平，而这些国家都是依靠出口导向型增长并通过制造业提高生产力和创造就业。,"Only a handful of economies over the last 60 years have fully caught up to advanced-economy living standards, and all relied on export-led growth to drive productivity and job creation in manufacturing.","In the last 60 years, only a handful of countries have managed to catch up with the advanced countries, and they did so by relying on export-led growth and manufacturing to raise productivity and create jobs."
他似乎更不会因为将其政府带入一场国际会议而与以色列交恶，就像他的父亲在1991年时与沙米尔总理之间那样。,"Nor does he seem eager to open a rift with Israel by dragging its government to an international conference, the way his father did with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir in 1991.","He seems less likely to pick a fight with Israel over bringing his government to an international conference, as his father did with Yitzhak Shamir in 1991."
在此看来陷入混乱的委内瑞拉成为第一个国家背书加密货币 （ “ Petro ” ） 的发行者绝非巧合。,It is no coincidence that dysfunctional Venezuela is the first issuer of a state-backed cryptocurrency (the “Petro”).,"It is no coincidence that the first country to issue its own cryptocurrency, the “Petro,” is Venezuela, which is mired in chaos."
爱尔兰在成为欧盟成员国的35年内几乎享受了不成比例的好处，到了2008年时还从欧盟预算中净赚了5亿欧元。,"Ireland has benefited disproportionately from EU largesse during its 35 years of membership, and, in 2008, was still receiving a net sum of €500 million from the EU budget.","Ireland has benefited disproportionately from its 35-year membership in the EU, netting €500 million from the EU budget in 2008."
今年1月的达沃斯世界经济论坛上，中国新任中央财经领导小组办公室主任刘鹤暗示即将到来的改革将以惊人的速度推进。,"At the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, Liu He, China’s new vice premier for economic policy, hinted that upcoming reforms would be carried out with surprising speed.","At the World Economic Forum in Davos this January, China’s newly appointed head of the Central Leading Group on Financial and Economic Affairs, Liu He, hinted that upcoming reforms would proceed at breakneck speed."
此外，尽管土耳其同意北约在其国内部署反导弹雷达系统，最近还扣留了一艘叙利亚注册的武装船只，这可能会取悦西方，但在这些事件中，土耳其的政策仍以“硬”军力为焦点。,"And, while Turkey’s agreement to host NATO anti-missile radar facilities, and its recent seizure of a Syrian-registered arms ship, may please the West, here, too, its policies are focused on “hard” military power.","Moreover, while Turkey’s agreement to host NATO’s missile-defense radar system, and its recent seizure of an armed ship flying the Syrian flag, may have pleased the West, Turkey’s policy in these events remained focused on “hard” military power."
但他们同时引入了目的完全相反的记忆法：通过将历史暴行的责任完全推给他人 — — 无论是希特勒的德国还是斯大林的苏联 — — 来粉饰国家叙事。,"But they have also introduced memory laws with essentially the opposite aim: to whitewash national narratives by shifting the responsibility for historical atrocities entirely onto others, whether Hitler’s Germany or Stalin’s Soviet Union.",But they also introduced a radically different form of memory: one in which the responsibility for historical atrocities was shifted entirely onto others – either Hitler’s Germany or Stalin’s Soviet Union – in order to sanitize the national narrative.
采用这一方法，发展中国家可以实现动态增长，形成就业创造和贫困减少的良性循环，即使其总体基础设施和营商环境仍然有所欠缺。,"With this approach, a developing country can grow dynamically, and create a virtuous circle of job creation and poverty reduction, even if its overall infrastructure and business environment are still lacking.","By adopting this approach, developing countries can achieve dynamic growth, create jobs, and reduce poverty, even if their overall infrastructure and business environments are lacking."
竞争可以迫使决策者确保透明和公正，从而成为恢复民主和实现政治机构现代化的有效手段，也许这才是最重要的。,"Perhaps most importantly, competition is a powerful means to restore democracy and modernize political institutions by compelling policymakers to ensure transparency and accountability.","Competition can force policymakers to ensure transparency and fairness, thereby becoming an effective means of restoring democracy and modernizing political institutions."
哥伦比亚、埃塞俄比亚、马来西亚、尼加拉瓜、巴基斯坦、坦桑尼亚和乌干达等国家极大地降低甚至取消了药品的关税和税收。,"Several countries, including Colombia, Ethiopia, Malaysia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Tanzania, and Uganda, have substantially reduced or eliminated tariffs and taxes on medicines.","Countries such as Colombia, Ethiopia, Malaysia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Tanzania, and Uganda have greatly reduced or eliminated taxes on medicines."
每天，专家们都对伊拉克叛乱、玻利维亚古柯种植、欧洲央行和北朝鲜政治局等各种各样的问题发表高见，但我们对他们的意见到底应该相信多少？,"Every day, experts bombard us with their views on topics as varied as Iraqi insurgents, Bolivian coca growers, European central bankers, and North Korea’s Politburo. But how much credibility should we attach to the opinions of experts?","Every day, experts opine on everything from Iraq’s insurgency to coca cultivation in Bolivia to the European Central Bank to North Korea’s Politburo. How much of what they say should we believe?"
与欧洲议会共同构成欧盟立法机构的欧洲部长理事会就像朝鲜一样充满秘密；事实上，上述委员会一贯闭门造车，从未留下任何的公共发言记录。,"The Council of Ministers – which, together with the European Parliament, makes up the EU’s legislature – is as impenetrably secretive as that of North Korea; indeed, it operates behind closed doors, without any public record of who said what.","The Council of European Ministers, which, together with the European Parliament, constitutes the EU’s legislative body, is as secretive as North Korea; indeed, the Council has never left a public record of its proceedings."
除了升级制造业之外，发展中国家应准备好实现向服务业的转型，因为随着收入的增加这是不可避免的 （尽管准确时间很难预测 ） 。,"Beyond upgrading manufacturing, developing countries should be preparing for the shift toward services that they will inevitably undergo as incomes rise (though the precise timing is hard to predict).","Beyond upgrading manufacturing, developing countries should prepare for a transition to services, as incomes rise (though the precise timing is difficult to predict)."
正如在线支付系统PayPal的联合创始人彼得·蒂耶（Peter Thiel）曾经指出的那样 ： “ 我们本想要能飞的汽车；谁知却最终收到了140个推特字符 。 ”,"It certainly didn’t resolve the big problems, such as eradicating poverty or enabling us to reach Mars. As PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel once noted: “We wanted flying cars; instead, we got 140 characters.”","As PayPal’s co-founder Peter Thiel once put it, “We wanted flying cars; instead we got 140 characters.”"
而他们对此的回应则涵盖对指标测量方式，劳动力市场结构转变，潜在性的投资机会缺乏，稀释生产率的技术创新以及技术导致的技能错配等问题。,"Their response covers concerns about measurement, structural shifts in the labor market, a potential paucity of investment opportunities, productivity-diluting technological innovations, and technology-driven skills mismatches.","Their response encompasses issues ranging from the way in which the indicators are measured, to shifts in the structure of the labor market, to a lack of potential investment opportunities, to technological innovations that dilute productivity, and to skill mismatches caused by technology."
AfD诞生于2013年，最初是一个批判欧元的“教授政党 ” ， 其中很多成员是经济自由派，新自由主义也一直是流淌在其血液中的DNA。,"The AfD was born in 2013 as a euro-critical “party of professors,” many of them economic liberals, and neoliberalism remains part of their offspring’s DNA.","The AfD was born in 2013 as a “professor’s party” critical of the euro, and many of its members are economic liberals and neoliberals."
欧元区最发达的国家德国经历了戏剧性的转折，2006年的国内生产总值增长了2.7 % ， 为2000年以后增长率之冠。,"Germany, the euro zone’s biggest economy, had a particularly dramatic turnaround, with annual GDP up by 2.7% in 2006, the highest rate since 2000.","Germany, the eurozone’s most advanced country, experienced a dramatic turnaround in 2006, with GDP growth of 2.7%, the highest rate since 2000."
他们不去想如何抵消经济活动中如1930年代深度收缩那样的过剩性波动，而是把焦点放在维持充分就业的所谓稳定性政策之上。,"Instead of pursuing measures to counter excessive fluctuations in economic activity, such as the deep contraction of the 1930’s, so-called stabilization policies focused on measures that aimed to maintain full employment.","Instead of thinking about how to offset excessive fluctuations in economic activity, as in the 1930’s, they focused on maintaining full employment through so-called stabilization policies."
但直到领导层在2012-2013年换届之前，中国的政策制定者们都将继续在罔顾巨额未来成本的情况下维持一个高增长率。,"Until the change of political leadership in 2012-2013, China’s policymakers may be able to maintain high growth rates, but at a very high foreseeable cost.","But until the leadership changes in 2012-2013, China’s policymakers will continue to maintain a high growth rate at the expense of large future costs."
公私合作是为了治理私营部门和开放市场，以推动有利于公共利益的经济增长，同时时刻关注环境可持续和社会包容。,"Public-private cooperation is about harnessing the private sector and open markets to drive economic growth for the public good, with environmental sustainability and social inclusiveness always in mind.","Public-private partnerships are needed to govern the private sector and open markets, in order to promote economic growth that is beneficial to the public interest, while also addressing environmental sustainability and social inclusion."
各国政府可以持续尝试说服俄罗斯，使其相信推翻当前政权要比让阿萨德的支持者逐渐陷入极端更有助于实现其利益。,Other governments can continue to try to convince Russia that its interests are better served by getting rid of the current regime than by permitting the continued radicalization of his opponents.,Governments can continue to try to convince Russia that overthrowing the current regime is preferable to allowing Assad’s supporters to become increasingly radicalized.
科学家和精神健康专业人士在主导型抑郁症的理解和治疗方面已取得重大的进展，包括发现了血清素和去甲肾上腺素等脑化学物的不平衡所起的作用。,"Scientists and mental health professionals have made major strides in understanding and treating major depression, including the discovery of the role played by imbalances in brain chemicals such as serotonin and noradrenaline.","Scientists and mental-health professionals have made significant progress in understanding and treating major depressive disorder, including identifying the role of imbalances of neurochemicals such as serotonin and dopamine."
他的继任者，马克·卡尼（Mark Carney）实践了这一观点，用一系列关键指标指引下的限制性自由决定权取代了固定的政策法则。,"His successor, Mark Carney, has come to embody this view, eschewing fixed policy rules in favor of the constrained discretion implied by guidance ranges for key indicators.","His successor, Mark Carney, practices this view, replacing a fixed policy rule with discretion guided by key indicators."
但随后它们“创建了国家，指定了统治者，划定了边境 ， （ 并引入了）国家制度 ” ， 但这并没有奏效。,"But then they “created countries, nominated rulers, delineated frontiers, [and introduced] a state system” that would not work.","But then they “created states, designated rulers, delineated borders, and (introduced) state institutions,” without success."
小泉在这些改革中取得了实质性的成功，使得被假公济私的自民党政客、官僚和商业巨头把持的、运转不灵的日本政府发生了重大转变。,"Koizumi had real successes in these reform efforts, which significantly transformed a malfunctioning Japanese state that was in the grip of pork-barrel LDP politicians, bureaucrats, and big business elites.","In these reforms, Koizumi achieved a real breakthrough, transforming a dysfunctional Japanese government run by self-serving LDP politicians, bureaucrats, and corporate giants."
事实上，就在对白沙瓦袭击表面的愤慨背后，本案最大的嫌疑人 — — 联合国指定的恐怖分子、曾担任LeT最高行动首领的扎基 - 乌尔 - 拉赫曼·拉赫维被允许取保候审。,"Indeed, under the cover of indignation over the Peshawar attack, the leading suspect in the case – UN-designated terrorist Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, who served as LeT’s operations chief – secured bail.","Indeed, behind the outrage over the Mumbai attacks lies the fact that the biggest suspect in the case – Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, a UN-designated terrorist and former chief of operations for LeT – was granted bail."
这一转型把世界交给了年青一代，他们比老一辈更精于技术，通过打破领土、语言和政府界限的社交网络彼此相连。,"This transformation has placed the world in the hands of a younger generation, more technologically savvy than their parents and connected to one another through social networks that are not confined by territory, language, or government.","This shift puts the world in the hands of the young, who are more technologically adept than their elders and are connected to one another through social networks that transcend territorial, linguistic, and governmental boundaries."
支持为自己珍视的普世价值观符合国际社会、尤其是西方国家的利益，这套价值观现在正在为欧洲邻国成百上千万民众所接受。,"It is in the interest of the international community, especially the West, to support the universal values that it holds dear – the same values that are now being embraced by millions of Europe’s neighbors.","The universal values that Europeans cherish are in the interest of the international community, and especially of Western countries, and are now accepted by millions of people in Europe’s neighborhood."
比如，加大农转医（farm-to-hospital）和农转学（farm-to-school）计划的投资能够确保居民形成更加健康的饮食习惯，加强地方经济，减少肉奶行业的气候影响。,"For example, higher investment in farm-to-hospital and farm-to-school programs would ensure healthier diets for residents, strengthen local economies, and reduce the climate impact of the meat and dairy industries.","Increased investment in farm-to-hospital and farm-to-school programs, for example, could ensure healthier diets for residents, strengthen local economies, and reduce the climate impact of the dairy industry."
1920年在德国爆发的极度通胀助长了巴伐利亚，莱茵兰以及萨克森地区的分离主义，因为这些偏远地区认为柏林的中央银行和中央政府歧视它们。,"Hyperinflation in Germany in the 1920’s fanned separatism in Bavaria, the Rhineland, and Saxony, because these remote areas thought that Germany’s central bank and central government in Berlin were discriminating against them.","Extreme inflation in Germany in 1920 fueled separatism in Bavaria, the Rhineland, and Saxony, where remote regions felt neglected by Berlin’s central bank and central government."
相反，2007年，109位民主党众议员投票赞成美国-秘鲁贸易促进协定（US-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement ） ， 原因正是其条款根据5月协定的要求做出了相应调整。,"In 2007, by contrast, 109 House Democrats voted in favor of the US-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement, precisely because its terms had been adjusted as requested and in line with the May agreement.","On the contrary, in 2007, 109 Democratic members of the House of Representatives voted in favor of the US-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement, precisely because its provisions were consistent with the May agreement."
这个想法听起来合乎逻辑，因为有一个可以让他安居乐业的好工作，人是不会与美国人或者他的伊拉克同胞交战的，对不对？,"The idea sounds logical: a man with a good job that enables him to build a decent life won’t want to fight Americans or his fellow Iraqis, right?","That sounds logical, doesn’t it? After all, there is a good job waiting for him, and he will not be fighting Americans or his fellow Iraqis, will he?"
模仿李光耀的政府模式 — — 而不是它的讽刺漫画形象 — — 需要允许远超中共可容忍程度的民主制度。,To emulate Lee’s model of government – rather than its cartoon caricature – would require allowing a far more democratic system than the CCP would ever tolerate.,Emulating Lee’s government model – not its caricature – would require allowing far more democratic institutions than the Chinese Communist Party can tolerate.
理查德·尼克松就是一个最好的例子，虽然他从来没有表达过对犹太人的好感，但不用质疑，在他的执政时期，以色列仍然是白宫最坚定的盟友。,"That was clearly the case with Richard Nixon, who never suffered from an excess of love for Jews, but was nonetheless one of the staunchest allies that Israel ever had in the White House.","Richard Nixon, for example, never expressed much affection for Jews, but there is no doubt that Israel was one of his administration’s closest allies."
劳动者们离开爱尔兰或者希腊并不是因为那里的生产力低下，而是因为只有离开那里，他们才能摆脱掉父母遭受的债务负担。,"Workers may leave Ireland or Greece not because their productivity there is lower, but because, by leaving, they can escape the debt burden incurred by their parents.","Workers leave Ireland or Greece not because productivity is low, but because only by leaving can they escape the debt burden that their parents face."
城市的人均收入高于农村，因此预计如今世界城市占据着全球收入的80%以上，其中最大的600个城市就占据了一半。,"Because per capita incomes are higher in cities than in rural areas, the world’s cities today are estimated to account for more than 80% of global income, with the largest 600 accounting for around half.","Cities have higher per capita incomes than rural areas, so it is expected that the world’s cities now account for more than 80% of global income, with the top 600 cities accounting for half."
所有这一切都凸显了一场不断深化的道德领导力危机，由此可能造成的损害丝毫不亚于不受控制的移民甚至贸易战。,All of this highlights a deepening crisis of ethical leadership that could do as much damage as uncontrolled migration or even a trade war.,"All of this underscores a deepening crisis of moral leadership, which could potentially do as much damage as an uncontrolled migration or trade war."
事实上，对TTIP协定的支持大幅滑坡，以至于欧盟委员会主席容克要求领导人在本月的欧洲理事会上重申他们对该协定的承诺。,"Support for the agreement has weakened so significantly, in fact, that European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has called for leaders to reaffirm their commitment to the deal at this month’s European Council.","Indeed, support for the TTIP deal has plummeted so much that European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has called on leaders to reaffirm their commitment to the deal at this month’s European Council."
就连外交政策也尽可能与崛起的中产阶级经济利益保持一致（虽然叙利亚干预行动反映外交政策重点发生了变化 ） 。,"Even foreign policy was, wherever possible, aligned with the economic interests of the rising middle class (though the Syrian intervention reflects a shift in foreign-policy priorities).",Even foreign policy has been aligned with the interests of the emerging middle class (though the intervention in Syria reflects a shift in priorities).
但一些观察者已经看到一些迹象表明这次冲击将带来更大的后果，发达经济体将陷入令人沮丧的反常长期低增长轨道。,"But some observers already saw signs that this shock would prove more consequential, with the advanced economies finding themselves locked into a frustrating and unusual long-term low-growth trajectory.","But some observers have already seen signs that this shock will have more far-reaching consequences, leading advanced economies into a sadly familiar pattern of sub-par growth."
所有美国的袭击都发生在偏远的北部，巴基斯坦部落的瓦齐里斯坦地区，尽管阿富汗塔利班及其哈卡尼组织和希克马蒂亚尔组织等盟友没有隐藏在那里。,"All of the US strikes have occurred farther north, in Pakistan’s tribal Waziristan region, although the leadership of the Afghan Taliban and of its allied groups, like the Haqqani network and the Hekmatyar band, is not holed up there.","All of America’s attacks have taken place in Pakistan’s far-flung tribal areas of North Waziristan, where the Afghan Taliban and its Haqqani and Hekmatyar allies are not hiding."
低利率使美元更具竞争力，但因为房地产的现状和信贷市场的功能失灵，除此之外的货币政策似乎失去了牵引力。,"The low interest rate helped by making the dollar more competitive, but otherwise monetary policy appears to have lost traction because of the condition of the housing sector and the dysfunctional state of the credit markets.","Low interest rates make the dollar more competitive, but, given the state of the housing market and the dysfunction of the credit markets, monetary policy otherwise seems to have little traction."
得到会做出更加稳健和平衡的政策响应的暗示能带来相当大的积极效应，尽管可能只是暂时有效（取决于实施情况 ） 。,"Hints that more robust and balanced policy responses are coming have had a noticeably positive effect, though it may be transitory, depending on implementation.","The suggestion of a more balanced and calibrated policy response can have a significant positive effect, even if only temporary (depending on implementation)."
作为一个政府办事员的女儿，玛雅瓦提曾攻读法律并做过教师，后来被社会报党（ BSP ）的创始人，已故的Kanshi RAM 发现，并培养了她的政治领导才能。,"The daughter of a government clerk, Mayawati studied law and worked as a teacher before being spotted by the BSP’s founder, the late Kanshi Ram, and groomed for political leadership.","As the daughter of a government clerk, Mayawati studied law and taught before being discovered by Kanshi Ram, the founder of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), who nurtured her political leadership skills."
委内瑞拉总统查韦斯已经公开提议废除央行的独立地位。 他呈交了一份允许他自由支配该国外汇储备的宪法改革方案。,"Venezuelan Preseident Hugo Chávez has openly proposed abolishing the central bank’s independence, submitting a constitutional reform that would allow him to use the country’s international reserves as he sees fit.","Venezuela’s president, Hugo Chávez, has publicly proposed abolishing the central bank’s independence. He has presented a constitutional reform that would allow him free access to the country’s foreign-exchange reserves."
欧盟国家有两个选择：它们可以徒劳地试图恢复过时的单一民族国家；也可以带着民族文化不但能存活下来、还能繁荣昌盛的认识接受多元化。,"The countries of the EU have two options: They can either make a vain attempt to revert to outdated, mono-ethnic models of statehood, or they can accept diversity with the realization that their national cultures will not only survive, but flourish.","European countries have two options: they can try in vain to restore the obsolete nation-state; or they can embrace multiculturalism not only as a way of surviving, but also as a way of thriving."
而8国的另外4个¾斯洛文尼亚、波兰、立陶宛和斯洛伐克¾都具备直选总统，但从政治和宪法的角度却没有一个能与库奇马领导的乌克兰相媲美。,"The other four - Slovenia, Poland, Lithuania, and Slovakia - have directly elected presidents, but none comes constitutionally and politically close to Kuchma's Ukraine.","And of the other four, Slovenia, Poland, Lithuania, and Slovakia, three – Slovenia, Poland, and Slovakia – have directly elected presidents, but none has a political and constitutional system comparable to Ukraine’s."
人们现在都想，当一个大到不允许崩坍的金融机构遇到问题的时候，政府便会介入疏通。 但是政府要帮到什么程度呢？,"In the past, government bailouts have typically protected all contributors of capital of a rescued bank other than shareholders.",Now everyone wants to know how far governments will go to bail out a financial institution that is too big to fail.
基于实用主义政治考虑（比如利比亚-意大利关系）或裙带主义的大资金分配应该被重新评估，并要以更好更强的治理实践作为标准。,"Large allocations based on pragmatic political concerns, such as Libya-Italy relations, or cronyism should be reevaluated in the light of better and stronger governance practices.","Pragmatic political considerations, such as the Libya-Italy relationship, or discreet money flows, should be re-evaluated, and governance practices should be held to a higher standard."
此外，在意大利等国家的比例选举制度（proportional voting system）中，通常无法产生单一的议会多数政党，总统往往需要行使任命总理的重要职责。,"Moreover, in proportional voting systems like Italy’s, where no single political party normally wins a majority of seats in parliament, the president often plays a key role in appointing the prime minister.","Moreover, in countries with proportional voting systems, such as Italy, it is often impossible to produce a single majority party in parliament, and presidents often exercise the important power of appointing prime ministers."
虽然他在1996年就当选巴勒斯坦立法委员会，但是他声名大振还是在2000年9月开始的因提法达起义中。,"Although he was elected to the Palestinian Legislative Council in 1996, Barghouti’s reputation soared when the current Intifada began in September 2000.","Though he was elected to the Palestinian Legislative Council in 1996, it was his role in the Intifada that began in September 2000 that made his name."
一些气象学家认为400 ppm的大气二氧化碳浓度已经超过了气候灾难触发点，数十亿人有成为难民的危险。,Some climate scientists believe that 400 ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere is already enough to take us past the tipping point at which we risk a climate catastrophe that will turn billions of people into refugees.,"Some climate scientists believe that atmospheric CO2 concentrations of 400 ppm have already triggered a climate catastrophe, with billions of people at risk of becoming climate refugees."
所幸中国的家庭和国企创造了庞大的储蓄，才使中国经济得以承受权贵资本主义造成的资源巨大浪费和扭曲配置。,"And, thanks to the large pool of savings generated by Chinese households and state-owned companies, the Chinese economy can for the time being bear the waste and misallocation implied by such crony capitalism.","Fortunately, China’s households and state-owned enterprises created large savings, enabling the economy to absorb the waste and misallocation caused by rent-seeking capitalism."
投资者认为这些风险或许不会升级，或者发达经济体的宽松货币政策和持续复苏能够遏制这些风险，这也许是对的。,"Investors may be right that these risks will not materialize in their more severe form, or that loose monetary policies in advanced economies and continued recovery will contain such risks.","Investors may be right that these risks will not materialize, or that advanced economies’ loose monetary policies and continued recovery will contain them."
多数历史学家都认为恐怖的伊凡名副其实；他不仅杀害了他的儿子和其他亲属，还下令执行1565到1572年令俄国陷入恐怖氛围的由国家主导的清洗运动（oprichnina ） 。,"Most historians agree that Ivan lived up to his name; not only did he kill his son and other relatives, he also ordered the oprichnina, the state-led purges that terrorized Russia from 1565 to 1572.","Most historians agree that Ivan the Terrible lived up to his name; not only did he kill his son and other relatives, he also ordered the state-sponsored pogroms (oprichnina) that terrorized Russia from 1565 to 1572."
相反，它们反映了变化的全球政治日程，在这个日程中，巴勒斯坦问题的重要性已经推举次席，这可能削弱以色列反思其镇压巴勒斯坦的行为的激励。,"On the contrary, they reflect a changing global political agenda that has relegated the question to a lower tier of importance, which is likely to weaken Israel’s incentive to rethink its suppression of Palestine.","Instead, they reflect the changing global political agenda, in which the Palestinian issue has been relegated to second place, which may weaken Israel’s incentive to reflect on its repression of the Palestinians."
在智利，如今53%的学生在受教育券资助的学校上学（其中许多直到最近才开始转为非盈利性学校 ） ， 尽管常常还需要缴纳额外的学费。,"In Chile today, 53% of all children attend voucher-financed private schools (many of them until recently run for profit), despite the top-up fees they often charge.","In Chile, for example, 53% of students now attend subsidized schools (many of which have recently become non-profit institutions), despite the need to pay additional fees."
因此，我们不能因为它限制了自由而拒绝这样的法律，相反，我们应该捍卫它，将它视为让个人和企业巨头平等竞争的方法，让我们的理性和思考不再受到掣肘。,"Instead of rejecting such laws as restricting freedom, therefore, we should defend them as ways to level the playing field between individuals and giant corporations that make no pretense of appealing to our capacities for reasoning and reflection.","So, instead of rejecting such laws because they restrict freedom, we should defend them as a way to level the playing field between individuals and corporate giants, and to liberate our reason and thought."
欧洲央行一直都尝试收拾南欧地区在推行欧元的最初一段时期形成的大量泡沫崩溃的残局，而这些政策只是这一系列尝试中的最新一项。,"These policies are, in essence, the latest in a string of attempts by the ECB to address the fallout of the collapse of the massive bubble that formed in southern Europe in the early years of the euro.","The ECB has been trying to clean up the mess left by the bursting of a large number of bubbles in the eurozone’s initial phase, and these policies are the latest in a series of such attempts."
比如，跨太平洋合作伙伴关系（Trans-Pacific Partnership，TPP）表明了奥巴马与占全球贸易三分之一、全球GDP百分之四十的地区形成一致的决心。,"For example, the negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) reflect President Obama’s determination to strike an accord with countries that represent one-third of global trade and 40% of global GDP.","For example, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) demonstrates Obama’s commitment to the region, which accounts for one-third of global trade and 40% of global GDP."
与此相反，中国的腐败通常都是“利益分享”型，那些国有企业高管的家庭成员都拥有股份，他们的收益随着企业盈利的上升而增加 — — 这是某种促进经济增长的腐败。,"By contrast, in China, the corruption has largely been of the “profit-sharing” variety, whereby family members are given a stake in the enterprise so that their earnings increase as profits increase – a type of corruption that promotes growth.","By contrast, corruption in China is often “share-the-loot” corruption, in which the family members of top state-owned enterprise executives are given shares in the enterprises, and their income rises with the enterprises’ profits – a form of corruption that can promote economic growth."
在民主制度的推动下，印度的政治决策分散化了，但相当多的经济决策当局仍嵌在新德里僵硬的官僚体制中，阻挠着经济增长。,"India was compelled by its democracy to pursue a politically decentralizing route, yet much economic decision-making authority remained embedded in New Delhi’s ossified bureaucracy, retarding growth.","India’s democratic system has dispersed political decision-making, but a large number of economic policymaking bodies remain embedded in New Delhi’s rigid bureaucracy, impeding growth."
除非从现在开始，否则战火将会在政治和宗教的助长下蔓延 — — 受害者也决不会仅限于尼尼微（Nineveh ） 。,"Unless we start now, the fires will spread – fanned by politics and religion – and it will not only be Nineveh that is consumed by them.","Unless action is taken now, the war will spread, fueled by politics and religion – not just in Nineveh."
如果欧洲对英施加贸易壁垒，企业选择投资其他地方来衔接欧洲单一市场，那么那些弱势地区的低收入工作岗位可能会完全消失或者进一步下调工资。,"If intra-European trade barriers are imposed, and companies choose to invest elsewhere to access Europe’s single market, lower-paid jobs in disadvantaged regions may disappear altogether, or wages will fall further.","If Europe erects trade barriers against the UK, firms will choose to invest elsewhere to access the single market, and low-paid jobs in the weakest regions could disappear or be further downgraded."
他在1991年发表的货币政策论文被广泛引用，其中开创性地提出了要避免出现设定极低的通胀目标，以便在某种程度上给中央银行创造降低利率的空间。,"His 1991 paper on monetary policy is widely cited as among the first to make the case for avoiding very low inflation targets, in part to give the central bank more room to lower interest rates.","His paper on monetary policy, published in 1991, has been widely cited for its innovative proposal to avoid setting a low inflation target in order to create some room for the central bank to lower interest rates."
但是，据盖洛普的调查，只有32%的美国人对传统媒体机构有“极大”或“相当大”的信任 — — 这一比例为历史最低。,"But, according to Gallup, only 32% of Americans have a “great deal” or “fair amount” of trust in traditional media outlets – an all-time low.","But, according to Gallup, only 32% of Americans have “a great deal” or “quite a lot” of trust in traditional media outlets – the lowest percentage on record."
他们可以随着治疗的进展而继续跟踪检查资金，他们的数据可以纳入医疗记录，提供对他们健康状况的长期检视，而不是在就医当日进行插入式拍片。,"They can continue to track themselves as their treatments progress, and their data can be integrated with medical records to provide a long-term view of their health, rather than an episodic snapshot of the day they visit a doctor.","They can continue to be tracked with follow-up funding as their treatment progresses, and their data can be incorporated into their medical records, providing long-term monitoring of their health, rather than a snapshot on the day of their visit."
考虑到普天间位于人口稠密的市区 — — 该地区有100多个学校、医院和商店，批评家们断言“鱼鹰”计划会危及到岛上成千上万居民的生命。,"Given that Futenma is located in a densely-populated urban area that includes more than 100 schools, hospitals, and shops, critics contend that the Osprey would endanger the lives of thousands of island residents.","Given that Palau is a densely populated urban area – home to more than 100 schools, hospitals, and shops – critics claimed that the project would endanger the lives of thousands of islanders."
多边开发银行和海外开发援助每年对基础设施融资的支持充其量也只能有40—60亿美元，即预计需要量的2—3 % 。,"Annual infrastructure financing from multilateral development banks and overseas development assistance is likely to amount to no more than $40-60 billion, or 2-3% of projected needs.","The Multilateral Development Banks and the Overseas Development Assistance agencies provide only $4-6 billion a year in support for infrastructure finance, or 2-3% of what is needed."
坦白说，选举结果只能影响制宪大会200个议席中的80席。 制宪大会将任命总理、政府以及宪法起草委员会。,"To be sure, the results will affect only 80 of the 200 seats in the constituent assembly, whose mandate is to appoint a prime minister, government, and a committee to draft the constitution.","To be sure, the outcome of the election will affect only 80 of the 200 seats in the Constituent Assembly, which will appoint the prime minister, the government, and the constitutional drafting committee."
它们尤其应该号召美国承担全球责任，用奥巴马描述对叙利亚的干涉的话说 ， “ 创造让他人崛起的条件和联盟 ” 。,"They should specifically call on the US to assume the mantle of global responsibility and, in the phrase that Obama used to describe the intervention in Libya, “create the conditions and coalitions for others to step up.”","They should especially call on the US to assume global responsibilities, as Obama described his intervention in Syria, by “creating the conditions and alliances for others to rise.”"
姆贝基应该知道，如果他关于引起艾滋病的原因和抗逆转录酶病毒药物功效的非正统观点是错误的，他的政策就会导致许多不必要的死亡。,"Mbeki must have known that, if his unorthodox views about the cause of AIDS and the efficacy of anti-retrovirals were wrong, his policy would lead to a large number of unnecessary deaths.","Mbeki should know that if his unconventional views about the causes of AIDS and the efficacy of anti-retroviral drugs are wrong, his policies will lead to many avoidable deaths."
像巴库提这样的当地法塔赫领袖掌握着民族主义武装的制高权力，它们组成了 “阿克萨烈士旅”这样的松散型组织。,Local Fatah leaders like Marwan Barghouti have tremendous power over the nationalist armed units that are loosely organized under the title of the Al Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades.,"Local Fatah leaders, such as Baku, wielded power over nationalist militias, such as the Aksa Martyrs’ Brigade, which were loosely organized."
但欧元债券是解决欧元危机根源 — — 加入欧元让成员国政府债券暴露在违约风险之下 — — 的显而易见的方案。,"Yet they are the obvious solution to the root cause of the euro crisis, which is that joining the euro exposed member countries’ government bonds to the risk of default.",But eurobonds are an obvious solution to the eurozone’s underlying problem – the exposure of member governments’ bonds to the risk of default.
其中曝光率最高的就是佐治亚州对特雷·戴维斯（Troy Davis）执行的死刑，此人被法庭裁定于1989年杀害了非当值警官马克·麦克费尔（Mark McPhail ） 。,"The one that gained the most publicity was the execution in Georgia of Troy Davis, who had been convicted of the 1989 murder of Mark McPhail, an off-duty police officer.","The most high-profile case was that of Troy Davis, who was executed in Georgia in 2011 after being convicted of murdering off-duty police officer Mark McPhail in 1989."
由于气候变化的影响，非洲正在经历1945年来最严重的干旱，尤其是在南苏丹、索马里、埃塞俄比亚和北尼日利亚等地区。,"Owing to the effects of climate change, Africa is experiencing its worst drought since 1945, especially in Southern Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, and Northern Nigeria.","As a result of climate change, Africa is experiencing its worst drought since 1945, particularly in South Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, and northern Nigeria."
它们是为国内不平��所困扰的正在崛起的力量，不停地向民族主义的方向发展、向处于主导地位的力量发起挑战，最终引发逆转经济全球化进展的世界战争。,"A rising power, beset with internal inequality, turns to nationalism and challenges the dominant power, provoking a war that turns back the progress of economic globalization.","They are the forces of domestic discontent that are on the rise, constantly challenging dominant powers and developing in a nationalist direction, ultimately triggering a world war to reverse economic globalization."
在东非共同体成员国看来，这个问题关乎去殖民化，即南苏丹民众几百年来被阿拉伯人奴役、羞辱、及遭受非人的待遇。,"To EAC members, this is a matter of de-colonization, for southern Sudan’s people have been enslaved, dehumanized, and humiliated for centuries by the Arabs.","For EAC member states, the issue is decolonization, as the people of South Sudan have been enslaved, humiliated, and subjected to inhuman treatment by Arabs for centuries."
我本人关于今天的停滞的理论关注人们对技术的迅速进步的焦虑。 技术的迅速进步可能最终取代大量乃至大部分工作岗位，造成巨大的经济不平等。,"My own theory about today’s stagnation focuses on growing angst about rapid advances in technologies that could eventually replace many or most of our jobs, possibly fueling massive economic inequality.","My own theory about today’s stagnation focuses on people’s fears about the rapid progress in technology that could eventually replace much of the workforce, causing massive economic inequality."
一位美国政治顾问迪克·莫里斯（Dick Morris）凭经验总结说 ： “ 魅力是政治特征中最难以捉摸的部分，因为它并不是任何实质性的存在；只有在一位候选人通过勤奋和某些巧妙的议题将其创造出来后，它才会出现于我们的观念之中 。 ”,"Dick Morris, an American political consultant, reports that in his experience, “charisma is the most elusive of political traits, because it doesn’t exist in reality; only in our perception once a candidate has made it by hard work and good issues.”","As the American political consultant Dick Morris has observed, “Charisma is the most elusive of the political characteristics, because it is not a real thing; it appears only when a candidate creates it through hard work and the right issues.”"
现在唯一的问题就是祖布科夫或者他的继任者是否会最终成功地把弗拉基米尔沙皇也变成像普京的对手已经变成的同样的那种“非人 ” 。,"The only question now is whether Zubkov, or his successor, will eventually succeed in turning Czar Vladimir into the same sort of non-person that Putin’s rivals have become.",The only question now is whether Zubkov or his successor will ultimately succeed in turning the Russian tsar into the same kind of “non-person” as Putin’s opponents have become.
国家主体要想找到方案，就有必要缓解紧张局势并实现妥协 — — 先是全球层面在美俄之间，后是地区层面，涉及伊朗、土耳其、沙特阿拉伯和以色列。,"For national actors to have space to find solutions, it is necessary to de-escalate tensions and find compromises – first globally, between the US and Russia, and then regionally, among Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Israel.","In order to find a solution, it is necessary to de-escalate tensions and reach compromises – first globally, between the US and Russia, and then regionally, involving Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Israel."
正如他的同一时代人熊彼得一样，罗伯森认为这些包含建立新资本和消灭旧资本的泡沫和破灭周期是��进步不可分离的。,"Like his contemporary, Schumpeter, Robertson regarded these boom-bust cycles, which involved both the creation of new capital and the destruction of old capital, as inseparable from progress.","Like his contemporaries Karl Marx and Peter Kropotkin, Roberts believed that these cycles of boom and bust, of creation and destruction of capital, were integral to progress."
具有讽刺意味的是，尽管法塔赫在议会选举中败北，冻结了巴勒斯坦资金的以色列人和国际社会还是想让阿巴斯继续控制安全部队。,"Ironically, the Israelis and the world community, which had basically frozen Palestinian finances, wanted Abbas to continue to control the security forces, despite Fatah’s loss in the parliamentary elections.","Ironically, despite Fatah’s electoral defeat, Israelis and the international community want Abbas to continue to control the security forces."
发自墨尔本 — — 许多年前，当我和太太开车载着三个年幼的女儿出行时，其中一个突然问了一句 ： “ 爸爸妈妈你们是希望我们聪明一点呢，还是快乐一点呢 ？ ”,"MELBOURNE – Many years ago, my wife and I were driving somewhere with our three young daughters in the back, when one of them suddenly asked: “Would you rather that we were clever or that we were happy?”","MELBOURNE – Many years ago, when my wife and I were driving our three young daughters somewhere, one of them suddenly asked, “Mummy, Daddy, do you want us to be smart or happy?”"
与此同时，著名波兰制片人阿格涅丝卡·霍兰德发表强烈抗议，反对自由媒体将皮奥特的抗议归结为精神病的结果。,"Meanwhile, the renowned Polish filmmaker Agnieszka Holland issued a strong rebuke against liberal media outlets that would attribute Piotr’s protest to mental illness.","Meanwhile, Agnieszka Holland, a renowned Polish filmmaker, protested strongly against the free press’s characterization of Piotrowski’s protest as a symptom of mental illness."
过去的经验表明，真实率将至少升至2 % ， 即使通胀预期继续维持在2 % ， 总名义利率也将升至4%以上。,"Past experience implies that the real rate will rise to at least 2%, taking the total nominal interest rate to more than 4%, even if expected inflation remains at just 2%.","Past experience suggests that the real rate will rise to at least 2%, even if inflation expectations remain anchored at 2%, implying a nominal interest rate of 4% or more."
总而言之，新兴经济体遭遇的是由外部产生的宏观经济转变，非常规货币政策，大范围的市场波动以及发达市场缓慢增长所带来的挑战。,"In short, emerging economies have been challenged by externally generated macroeconomic shifts, unconventional monetary policies, widespread volatility, and slow growth in developed markets.","In short, emerging economies are facing a macroeconomic transformation driven by external factors, unconventional monetary policies, wide swings in markets, and slow growth in advanced economies."
他并未设定具体的收入目标，但可以肯定地说，他或许预期中国能有更好的表现：根据世界银行的标准，世纪之交的中国依然属于中低收入国家。,"He did not set a specific income goal, but it is safe to say that he probably expected China to do better than it did: by World Bank standards, China at the turn of the century was a lower-middle-income country.","He did not set specific income targets, but it is likely that he expected China to do better: according to World Bank standards, China at the turn of the century was still a lower-middle-income country."
（另外一个被选中的国家伊拉克同样被原来的禁穆令所激怒；其他目标国包括利比亚、索马里、苏丹、叙利亚和也门 ） 。,"(Iraq, one of the other states singled out, was equally incensed by the original order; the other countries targeted were Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen).","(Another country selected, Iraq, is also on the original list; other targets include Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.)"
一旦他们意识到他们不能威吓ECB进行不必要的自我消亡式的利率降低，欧盟领导人也许能鼓起领导的勇气 — — 这毕竟是他们被选举出来所要完成的任务。,"Once they realize they can’t bully the ECB into unwanted and self-destructive interest rate cuts, EU leaders actually might summon up the will to lead—which is, after all, what they have been elected to do.","Once they realize that they cannot intimidate the ECB into engaging in self-destructive interest-rate cuts, EU leaders may find the courage to lead – after all, that is what they were elected to do."
这些进步部分可以归因于创新，包括只需要几分钟的新型快速诊断测试、更普及和廉价的抗疟疾药物，以及越来越普遍的长效防虫蚊帐（LLIN）的使用。,"Progress can be attributed partly to innovations, including new rapid diagnostic tests that work in just minutes, more accessible and affordable anti-malarial drugs, and rising use of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs).","Much of this progress can be attributed to innovation, including new rapid diagnostic tests that can be administered in just a few minutes, more affordable and accessible antimalarial drugs, and increasingly widespread use of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs)."
9月，世界领导人齐聚联合国参与了年度讨论，他们一致通过了以一个中心点：战胜贫困、饥饿和疾病的重要性事关人类整体生存大事。,"The world leaders who met at the UN in September for the annual General Debate all agreed on a central point: the importance of fighting poverty, hunger, and disease is crucial for our collective survival.","In September, world leaders gathered at the United Nations to participate in the annual discussion, and they unanimously agreed on a central theme: the importance of combating poverty, hunger, and disease to the survival of humanity as a whole."
非洲领导人需要铲除贪污，加强能源公用事业治理（其中某些已经成为腐败和效率低下的核心）透明度、强化法律法规并加大对能源基础设施的公共投入。,"African leaders need to root out graft, make the governance of energy utilities – some of which have been centers of corruption and inefficiency – more transparent, strengthen regulations, and increase public spending on energy infrastructure.","African leaders need to root out corruption, strengthen the governance of energy utilities (some of which have become corrupt and inefficient), improve transparency, strengthen the rule of law, and increase public investment in energy infrastructure."
最有效的征税方法之一是美国工资税，该税种的边际税率接近于平均税率（因为不存在减税，税率结构的累进性也较低 ） 。,"One of the most efficient tax-raising methods is the US payroll tax, for which the marginal tax rate is close to the average rate (because deductions are absent and there is little graduation in the rate structure).","One of the most efficient taxes is the US wage tax, which has a marginal rate close to the average rate (because there is no deduction and the tax structure is less progressive)."
为了重塑美国的道德领导力，总统奥巴马必须兑现他曾经说过的话，真正给受压迫的人民带去曙光 — — 如他在就任总统早期在伊斯坦布尔和开罗说的那样。,"In order to restore America’s moral leadership, President Barack Obama must make good on his early rhetoric – exemplified in his speeches in Istanbul and Cairo early in his presidency – which demonstrated genuine regard for the oppressed.","To restore America’s moral leadership, President Barack Obama must fulfill the promise he made in Istanbul and Cairo early in his presidency to bring light to the oppressed."
历史告诉我们，外交通常只有在强权的支持下才能带来结果。 这就是美国前总统、诺贝尔和平奖获得者西奥多·罗斯福的存在主义世界观。,History teaches that diplomacy all too frequently produces results only when backed by overwhelming power.,"History teaches us that diplomacy often works only with the support of power. This is the existentialist worldview of former US President Theodore Roosevelt, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate."
作为在抗击HIV领域有10余年经验的非洲活动家，我希望世卫组织能在迈出建议使用PrEP这关键一步的基础上更上一层楼。,"As an African activist with more than ten years of experience in the fight against HIV, I hope that the WHO will build on its important first step of advising the use of PrEP.","As an African activist with more than a decade of experience in the fight against HIV, I hope that WHO will build on this critical step and take the next one."
如果美国成功地施展其军事力量，将会缔造出一个崭新、民主的中东；可如果军事霸权遭受失败，带来的必将是地区的动荡和权力的真空。,"Were the US to succeed in using its military strength, it would create a new, democratic Middle East. But were it, despite its military might, to fail, it would create a power vacuum and destabilize the region.","If the US succeeds in exercising its military power, it will create a new, democratic Middle East; if it fails, the result will be chaos and power vacuums in the region."
如果支付公平合理的一次性补偿，那么绝大多数公务员就都可以接受，公众舆论也会对拒绝接受的贪婪或懒惰之辈表示不满。,"If a fair one-time payment is offered, it is likely to be taken up by a majority of civil servants, and public opinion will frown upon the greedy or lazy ones who turn it down.","If a fair and reasonable one-time payment were offered, most civil servants would accept it, and the public would be outraged by those who refused."
叙利亚的残酷战争已经夺去了250，000人的生命、导致2100万民众近半数流离失所，并驱使百万难民赴欧洲寻求庇护。,"In Syria, a brutal war has already taken 250,000 lives, displaced half of the country’s 21 million people, and sent a million refugees to Europe seeking asylum.","Syria’s brutal war has claimed more than 250,000 lives, displaced nearly half of the country’s population, and driven millions of refugees to Europe."
我们需要建立不会因为爆发被控制住就马上被撤销的研究项目，这能够极大地丰富我们更好地管理下一次传染病暴发的办法。,"By creating research grants that do not expire as soon as an outbreak is under control, we would substantially increase our portfolio of solutions to manage the next epidemic better.","We need to establish research projects that will not be shut down as soon as an outbreak is brought under control, thereby enriching our ability to manage future outbreaks more effectively."
在10月5日的首轮投票后，两位女性之间的斗争看起来已是不可避免，因为民调显示两人都不太可能获得50%的选票。,"A run-off between the two women, following the October 5th first round, seems inevitable, as opinion polls give neither close to 50% of the vote.","After the first round of voting on October 5, the contest between the two women looked inevitable, as polls showed that neither was likely to get 50% of the vote."
首先，他为核武器辩护，认为它是地区或全球稳定之源，这大大低估了核武器落入恐怖分子之手或因为误算而使用的危险。,"First, by defending nuclear weapons as a source of regional or global stability, he profoundly underestimated the danger that they could fall into the hands of terrorists or be used because of a miscalculation.","First, he defends nuclear weapons as a source of regional or global stability, which greatly underestimates the dangers of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists or being used by mistake."
在2011年，欧盟启动了塞尔维亚和科索沃之间的对话，并随之带来了行动自由、贸易自由、经济机会、安全、公正、互联互通以及其他许多方面的重大利益。,"In 2011, the EU initiated a dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo that has since produced significant benefits in terms of freedom of movement, trade, economic opportunities, security, justice, connectivity, and much else.","In 2011, the EU initiated a dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo, bringing with it significant benefits in terms of action, trade, economic opportunities, security, justice, connectivity, and many other areas."
一部分 ， “ 记忆的丰富遗产”是植根于过去。 而另一部分，与现在相关并通往未来，是以公民共同建造公共生活的普遍意愿为构成要素的。,"One part, the “rich inheritance of memories,” is rooted in the past, while the other, related to the present and opening the way to the future, consists in the common will of citizens to build their public life together.","One part is rooted in the past, while the other is relevant to the present and points to the future, and is constituted by elements of a general will to build public life together as citizens."
美国 — — 以及全世界 — — 需要通过协商和熟虑制定公共政策，而不是让一个病态日深的人来制定公共政策。,"The US – and the world – needs public policy by consultation and deliberation, not one man’s worsening pathology.","The United States – and the world – needs to develop public policies through negotiation and deliberation, not by allowing a sick person to dictate them."
我最近在第五大道上的以马内利会堂 — — 这里堪称纽约最美轮美奂的犹太教堂，也是世界最大的犹太教堂之一 — — 接受了《纽约时报书评 》 （ New York Times Book Review）编辑帕梅拉·保罗（Pamela Paul）的采访。,"At Temple Emanu-El on Fifth Avenue, the most beautiful synagogue in New York and one of the largest in the world, I was recently interviewed by Pamela Paul, editor of the New York Times Book Review.","I recently sat down for an interview with Pamela Paul, the editor of the New York Times Book Review, at Temple Emanu-El on Fifth Avenue – one of New York’s most beautiful synagogues, and one of the largest in the world."
尽管长期停滞在2008年金融危机发生五年后成了一种模因（meme ） ， 但这个术语本身的历史要悠久得多。,"Although secular stagnation became a meme five years after the 2008 financial crisis, the term itself is much older.","Although the term “secular stagnation” has become a meme five years after the 2008 financial crisis, the term itself has a long history."
"这些疾病不仅包括 HIV，还包括肺结核，光去年死亡人数就达到了32,000。 此外，其教育标准也在严重下滑。","It heads the list on the spread of preventable diseases – not only HIV, but tuberculosis, with 32,000 deaths last year alone – and its education standards are in severe decline.","These diseases include not only HIV, but also tuberculosis, which killed 32,000 people last year, as well as declining educational standards."
在被问及赫鲁晓夫为什么会被剥夺权力时，俄罗斯政坛“不倒翁”安德烈·葛罗米柯（Andrei Gromyko）据说打趣道 ， “ 赫鲁晓夫是一个鲁莽的赌徒，还好我们守住了莫斯科 。 ”,"When asked why Nikita Khrushchev was removed from power, the longtime Soviet politician Andrei Gromyko allegedly joked, “Khrushchev was so reckless a gambler, we would be lucky to hold on to Moscow.”","When asked why Khrushchev had been deposed, the “non-retired” Soviet politician Andrei Gromyko supposedly quipped, “Khrushchev was a reckless gambler, fortunately we saved Moscow.”"
所有部门都有其外部负责对象，但一些部门的前端“客户代表”性质更重：它们的核心任务包括协调经济中不同部分公共品的供应。,"While all ministries have their external constituencies, some ministries have more of a front-end, “account executive” nature: their core mission involves coordinating the provision of public goods to different parts of the economy.","All sectors have external stakeholders, but some are more “client-facing”: their core mission is to coordinate the supply of public goods across different parts of the economy."
但实证研究表明这一观点存在一个根本性的自相矛盾之处：自邓小平改革开始以来，中国TFP平均年增长率达到了近4 % 。,But empirical research reveals a fundamental problem with this argument: China’s TFP has grown at an average annual rate of nearly 4% since Deng’s reforms began.,"But there is a fundamental contradiction in this view: since Deng Xiaoping’s reforms began, China’s TFP has averaged nearly 4% per year."
法国、爱尔兰、丹麦、荷兰、意大利和希腊等国多次公投结果因此得到逆转，即使其中涉及堕胎与离婚等有浓重感情色彩的内容。,"That is how numerous referendum outcomes – in France, Ireland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Italy, and Greece – have been reversed, even when deeply emotional issues, such as abortion and divorce, were involved.","Referendums in France, Ireland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Italy, and Greece have been overturned, even when they involved emotionally charged issues like abortion and divorce."
比如，智利铜矿被迫启开始使用脱盐水来进行开采作业，瑞典的Boliden公司42%的能源需求用可再生资源满足。,"In Chile, for example, copper mines have been forced to start using desalinated water for extraction, while Sweden’s Boliden sources up to 42% of its energy needs from renewables.","For example, Chile’s copper mines have been forced to switch to desalinated water for mining operations, and 42% of Boliden’s energy needs in Sweden are met by renewable sources."
虽然基于市场的倡议是推动创新的重要因素，但在激活绿色金融、确保气候风险披露等工作需要政府和监管者更多地开展交流合作。,"While market-based initiatives are important drivers of innovation, governments and regulators also have a crucial role to play in activating green finance and ensuring that climate risks are measured and reported accurately.","While market-based initiatives are an important driver of innovation, more communication and cooperation between governments and regulators is needed to activate green finance and ensure climate-risk disclosure."
经济体学习的速度可以超过其创造的速度，所以欠发达国家相比今天的工业化国家，在向富裕的道路迈进时，前者比后者的成长速度更快。,"Economies can learn faster than they can invent, so less developed countries can achieve much faster growth than was experienced by today’s industrialized countries when they were becoming wealthy.","Economies learn faster than they create, so that, compared to today’s industrialized countries, the poorer countries grow faster on the path to richness."
虽然这种方法一直备受争议，因为它意味着将经济的实质控制权交给非由选举产生的技术官僚，但过去的通货膨胀事件已经令中央银行的独立地位得到了广泛认同。,"While this approach has always been controversial, given that it implies handing substantial control over the economy to unelected technocrats, past inflationary episodes have fostered broad acceptance of central-bank independence.","While this approach has long been controversial, because it means ceding control of the economy to non-elected technocrats, past episodes of inflation have led to widespread acceptance of the central bank’s independence."
为此他呼吁将欧元打造为“一个新的、更具主权意义的欧洲的工具 ” ， 并承诺要“推出一些加强欧元国际作用的举措 ” 。,"He then called for the euro to become “the instrument of a new, more sovereign Europe,” and promised to “present initiatives to strengthen the international role of the euro.”","To that end, he called for the euro to be “an instrument of a new, more sovereign Europe,” and pledged to take “steps to strengthen the euro’s international role.”"
缓慢的衰落 — — 如古罗马和十八世纪的西班牙 — — 要比迅速衰落的破坏性小得多，但最终，最佳情形是未来十年俄罗斯以重新平衡的复苏面貌出现。,"A gradual decline, like that of ancient Rome or eighteenth-century Spain, is less disruptive than a rapid one, but ultimately the best scenario would feature a recovering and rebalanced Russia over the next decade.","Slow decline – like that of ancient Rome or eighteenth-century Spain – is less destructive than rapid decline, but, in the end, the best-case scenario for the next decade is a Russia that rebalances and recovers."
如果中国领导人继续选择债务驱动型增长优先、压倒改革，也只能推迟 — — 可能时间很长 — — 不可避免的减速。,"If China’s leaders continue to choose debt-fueled growth over reform, they will only delay, and possibly prolong, the inevitable slowdown.","If China’s leaders continue to prioritize debt-driven growth over reform, they will only postpone – perhaps for a long time – the inevitable slowdown."
另一个例子在秘鲁，30余家金融机构选择了类似的非传统方法盈利，它们合作建立了Modelo Perú，一家提供数字金融服务的平台。,"Another example is to be found in Peru, where more than 30 financial institutions chose a similarly unconventional path to profitability, working together to establish Modelo Perú – a platform that provides digital financial services.","Another example is Peru, where more than 30 financial institutions have opted for a similar non-traditional approach to profitability, working together to create Modelo Perú, a platform that provides digital financial services."
即使在收入分配确实开始改善的最好情况下，所有派别的经济学家全都赞同的一个观点是可能会极为缓慢的发生变化。,"Even in the best-case scenario, in which income distribution did begin to improve, one thing economists of all stripes agree on is that change would be glacially slow.","Even in the best-case scenario of improved income distribution, it is likely to be a very slow process."
与此同时，哈马斯认为阿巴斯争取联合国承认的努力是为了给内塔尼亚胡施压，从而重启基于1967年边境线的和平谈判。 哈马斯是不承认1967年边境线的。,"At the same time, Hamas suspects that Abbas’s effort to gain UN recognition is intended to impose pressure on Netanyahu to revive peace negotiations on the basis of the 1967 borders, a position that Hamas rejects.","At the same time, Hamas believes that Abbas’s quest for UN recognition is aimed at pressuring Netanyahu into resuming peace talks based on the 1967 borders, which Hamas does not recognize."
在美国境内，过去三年就业人口从2007年的1.378亿人轻微下降到2010年7月的1.3亿人，减少了790万人 — — 要知道这段时间内人口还增长了600万。,"In the United States, the past three years have seen employment fall from 137.8 million people in July 2007 to slightly less than 130 million in July 2010 – a decline of 7.9 million during a period in which the adult population grew by six million.","Within the United States, the employed population has declined by 7.9 million, or 6%, from 137.8 million in July 2007 to 130 million in July 2010."
我们的方法II的理性总是能够指向每个理性的个人都会同意的最优选择的��蒙观点，和多数 合理 选择这一广泛接受的现代观点相冲突。,The Enlightenment idea that our System-II rationality can always point to an optimal choice about which every reasonable individual would agree clashes with the widely accepted modern idea that there is a plurality of reasonable choices.,"Our method II is rational in the sense that it always points to the individual’s best option, which conflicts with the widely accepted modern view of the majority rule."
即将上任的总统及其周围的顾问将面对压力迅速解决所有这些关注和问题，但他们在上述领域循序渐进才是明智之举。,"The incoming president and those around him will come under pressure to address all these issues and concerns quickly, but they would be well advised to take their time.","The president-elect and his advisers will face pressure to resolve all of these concerns and issues quickly, but it would be wise to proceed cautiously in these areas."
特朗普上台对美国经济和工人固然是个坏消息，其气候变化、人权、媒体和确保和平与稳定的政策对所有人的伤害也一样深远。,"As bad as his administration will be for America’s economy and workers, its policies on climate change, human rights, the media, and ensuring peace and security are likely to be no less damaging for everyone else.","Trump’s election is bad news for the US economy and workers, but it is also bad news for climate change, human rights, media, and policies that ensure peace and stability."
对安倍来说，夏威夷与奥巴马握手等于认同日本的现代和平主义信念，并释放出一个信号：尽管以民族主义者闻名，但他对战争的危险也有着深刻的认识。,"By shaking Obama’s hand in Hawaii, Abe will give a nod to the country’s modern pacifist creed, and signal that, despite his reputation as a nationalist, he also harbors deep feelings about the dangers of war.","For Abe, shaking Obama’s hand in Hawaii amounted to an endorsement of Japan’s modern pacifist beliefs, and a signal that, despite his reputation as a nationalist, he, too, is aware of the dangers of war."
仅仅四分之一个世纪之前，关于经济制度的争论 — — 国家管理的社会主义还是自由民主和资本主义 — — 似乎已经尘埃落定。,"Just a quarter-century ago, the debate about economic systems – state-managed socialism or liberal democracy and capitalism – seemed to have been settled.","Just a quarter-century ago, the debate over economic systems – state-managed socialism or liberal democracy and capitalism – seemed settled."
这种愈演愈烈的疏离情绪在美国国务卿希拉里·克林顿对装备了核武器的巴基斯坦安全情况不断恶化且对美国“造成致命”威胁的指责中发挥了极大的作用。,This growing alienation probably played a considerable part in US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton saying that deteriorating security in nuclear-armed Pakistan “pose(d) a mortal” threat to the US.,This growing estrangement has played a major role in US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s increasingly harsh condemnation of Pakistan’s deteriorating security situation and its “mortal threat” to the US.
如果你像今秋的我一样去过美国或亚洲，那么欧洲的形象大概会有选择地更加光明一些：尽管欧洲仍被视为积极的模式，但已不再被看作全球行动者。,"If one travels to America or Asia, as I did this autumn, Europe’s image becomes selectively brighter: while it continues to be perceived as a positive model, it is no longer considered a global actor.","If, like me this fall, you travel to the US or Asia, Europe’s image is likely to be somewhat brighter: though still seen as a positive model, Europe is no longer seen as a global actor."

但他的总统任期不是耶鲁大学历史学家蒂莫西·斯奈德（Timothy Snyder）和其他人所认为的二十世纪法西斯主义的回放。,"But his presidency is not a replay of twentieth-century fascism, as Yale historian Timothy Snyder and others have argued.","But his presidency is not a replay of twentieth-century fascism, as Yale historian Timothy Snyder and others have argued."
我们只不过尚未具备足够的深刻洞察力去理解在一场遥远的变革 — — 不管是一场金融危机还是爆发式增长 — — 中所有的因素将如何互动。,"We simply do not yet have sufficiently precise insights into how all of its elements interact during times of far-reaching change, whether it be a financial crisis or a growth spurt.",We lack the deep insight to understand how all the factors will interact in a distant transformation – whether a financial crisis or explosive growth.
为了更好地贯彻IMF双重宗旨的另外一半，IMF已经释出信号，表明它将增募资金，从2009年4月伦敦G20会议上通过的7500亿美元增加到1万亿美元。,"In order to better carry out the other half of its dual mandate, the IMF has signaled that it will ask for a further increase in its resources, to $1 trillion, up from the $750 billion agreed at the London G-20 meeting in April 2009.","To better fulfill the other half of the IMF’s dual mandate, the Fund has signaled that it will increase its resources, from the $750 billion approved at the London G-20 summit in April 2009, to $1 trillion."
如果欧洲领导人认真对待COP21承诺，就应该在2030年在2010年消费水平的基础上减少70 % ， 这一目标比欧洲理事会2014年的目标宏大一倍。,"If European leaders are serious about their COP21 commitment, they should embrace a 70% reduction on 2010 consumption levels by 2030 – more than double the European Council’s 2014 target.","If European leaders are serious about their COP21 commitments, they should aim to reduce emissions by 70% from 2010 levels by 2030, a goal that is more than twice as ambitious as the European Council’s target in 2014."

共和党人害怕他们可能同时失去参众两院，虽然鉴于更多民主党在职议员必须保住自己的席位，失去参议院的情况不大可能发生。,"Republicans have been in a panic that they might lose both the House and the Senate, though the latter is less likely, given that many more Democratic than Republican incumbents must defend their seats.","Republicans fear that they could lose both houses of Congress, although, given that more Democrats are in office, it is unlikely that they will lose the Senate."
但1997年亚洲金融危机后，收入差距开始在整个地区拉大，印尼尤其严重，社会福利计划对于阻止不平等性的加剧几乎毫无作用。,"But, since the Asian financial crisis in 1997, income gaps have widened throughout the region, and in Indonesia in particular, where social welfare programs have barely stemmed the rise in inequality.","But, after the Asian financial crisis of 1997, the income gap began to widen throughout the region, with Indonesia in particular suffering, and social welfare programs did little to stem the rise of inequality."

然而，即使是来自联合国的最悲观的预测也预期发展中国家的普通民众在2100年时会比现在更富裕，也因此能更好的应对这一挑战。,"However, by 2100, even the most pessimistic forecasts from the UN expect the average person in the developing countries to be richer than now, and thus better able to cope.","However, even the most pessimistic United Nations forecasts predict that the average person in a developing country will be better off in 2100 than he or she is today, and thus better able to cope with this challenge."

悄无声息地采用自下而上的方法相当于心照不宣地承认不能强迫各国遵守一项严格的集中制度，即使上述制度的依据是科学。,"The quiet adoption of a bottom-up approach is a tacit admission that countries cannot be forced to abide by a strict, centralized regime, even if it is based on scientific evidence.","Quietly adopting a top-down approach is tantamount to tacitly admitting that one cannot force countries to adhere to a strict centralized system, even if that system is based on science."
