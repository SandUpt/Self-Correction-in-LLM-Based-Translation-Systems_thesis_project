2001年，英国足总（英国足球监管机构）启动了为期五年的儿童安全措施评估，但只开展了两年便不了了之，据说是因为一些足总工作人员的抵制。,"The five-year review of child safety measures, launched by the Football Association (the governing body of UK soccer) in 2001, was dropped after just two years, reportedly in response to resistance from some FA staff.","In 2001, the English Football Association (English football regulatory body) launched a five-year evaluation of child safety measures, but only conducted it for two years before abandoning it, allegedly due to the resistance of some Football Association employees."

发自华盛顿 — — 虽然沙特驻美大使阿德尔·朱拜尔在美国宣称挫败的暗杀阴谋中毫发未伤，但如果这一行动的真正目标并不是朱拜尔，而是为了破坏伊朗总统内贾德的外交政策的话，那么策划者的目的或许已经实现了。,"WASHINGTON, DC – Though Saudi Ambassador Adel al-Jubeir is alive and well in Washington, the plot to assassinate him may have succeeded – if its aim was not to kill al-Jubeir, but rather Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s foreign policy.",Task: Translate the Chinese sentence into English.
持续60年的残酷镇压甚至都难以让西藏和新疆认同这一点，这从2008年的西藏人和2009年的维吾尔人爆乱中可以得知。,"Six decades of ruthless repression has failed to win China acceptance even in Tibet and Xinjiang, as the Tibetan and Uighur revolts of 2008 and 2009 attested.",Task: Translate the Chinese sentence into English.

他的支持是2006年玻利维亚总统埃沃·莫拉莱斯当选的决定因素，虽然引发了激烈的争论，但在其后的一年里他又支持了尼加拉瓜的丹尼尔·奥尔特加和厄瓜多尔的拉斐尔·科雷亚。,"His backing was a decisive influence in the election of Bolivia’s President Evo Morales in 2006, and the following year he supported Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua and Rafael Correa in Ecuador, though his impact on their victories is hotly debated.","His support was a decisive factor in the election of Evo Morales as president of Bolivia in 2006, although it sparked fierce debate, but in the following year he also supported Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua and Rafael Correa of Ecuador."

法德首脑11月中旬在法国多维尔提出倡议修订《里斯本条约 》 ， 把出台强制债务重组机制的时间定在2013年以后，也是为了避免短期内爆发减记潮所可能造成的冲击。,"The Franco-German initiative unveiled at Deauville in early November, which would require some possible measure of restructuring for debt issued after 2013, tried to avoid the immediate shock of a haircut.","The leaders of France and Germany put forward a proposal to amend the Lisbon Treaty in mid-November 2011, and to postpone the issuance of the compulsory debt restructuring mechanism to after 2013, in order to avoid the impact of the debt crisis."

现在，美国不应该重复“这与伊斯兰教无关”之类的老生常谈，而应该承认美国已经成为激进伊斯兰与开明伊斯兰和法治之间的战斗的新战场。,"Instead of repeating like a broken record that “this has nothing to do with Islam,” it is time to admit that the US has become yet another theater in the battle between the Islam of the radicals and the Islam of enlightenment and the rule of law.",Task: Translate the Chinese sentence into English.

在这一背景下，必须指出，尽管金正恩的和平提议是出于渴望重建饱受制裁摧残的朝鲜经济的动机，但改变一个惯于忍受极端艰难时期的国家的行为绝非仅靠制裁。,"In this context, it is important to note that, while Kim’s peace overtures are motivated by a desire to rebuild North Korea’s sanctions-battered economy, sanctions alone did not change the behavior of a country long used to enduring extreme hardship.","In this context, it is necessary to point out that although Kim Jong-un’s peace proposal is motivated by the desire to rebuild the North Korean economy, which has been severely damaged by sanctions, changing the behavior of a country that is accustomed to enduring extreme hardship is not possible solely through sanctions."

举例来说，斯堪的那维亚国家、地中海国家以及像爱尔兰和英国那样的“自由的大西洋国家”之间的差别在某些时候要比欧洲整体和美国之间的差别还要大。,"The differences for instance between the Scandinavian countries, the Mediterranean countries, and the “liberal Atlantic countries” like Ireland and the UK are sometimes more pronounced than those between Europe as a whole and the US.","For example, the difference between the Scandinavian countries, the Mediterranean countries, and the “free Atlantic countries” such as Ireland and the United Kingdom is sometimes greater than the difference between Europe as a whole and the United States."
对于在今年保持发达经济体增长来说，这已经足够；不幸的是，对于发达经济体人民 — — 以及全球经济 — — 所急需的更快的增长来说，这还不够。,"That will be enough to keep the advanced economies growing this year; unfortunately, it will not be enough to attain the faster growth that their citizens’ wellbeing – and that of the global economy – urgently requires.","As far as maintaining the growth of a developed economy is concerned, this is already enough; unfortunately, for the people of developed economies — — and for the global economy — — what is needed is faster growth, and this is still not enough."

“民主”一词来自古希腊语，你也可以在希腊哲学中找到民主思想的核心要素，但这一事实并不意味着民主只存在于西方政治DNA中。,"The fact that the word “democracy” derives from ancient Greek, and that one can discern the kernel of democratic thought in Greek philosophy, by no means implies that democracy is embedded in the West’s political DNA.","The word “democracy” comes from ancient Greek, and you can also find the core elements of the idea of democracy in Greek philosophy, but this fact does not mean that democracy only exists in the political DNA of the West."
美国国会肯定是一无所知的；其成员仍然忙于为政府支持的住房抵押贷款机构 — — 房利美和房地美 — — 四处游说，从而把危机推向更深处。,"Certainly the US Congress was clueless; its members were still busy lobbying for the government-backed housing-mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, thereby digging the hole deeper.",Task: Translate the Chinese sentence into English.
但旧体系已不再能够提供有用的答案，俄罗斯通过无视联合国安理会（基于国家的国际制度的最高形式）关于乌克兰问题的决议以及在安理会叙利亚决议上从中作梗证明了这一点。,"Yet the old systems no longer offer useful answers, as Russia has demonstrated by brushing aside the United Nations Security Council – the high altar of the state-based international system – over Ukraine and stalemating it over Syria.","But the old system can no longer provide useful answers, Russia has proved this by ignoring the UN Security Council (the highest form of the international system based on the state) resolution on the Ukrainian issue and making a knot on the Security Council resolution on Syria."

如果希腊政府当时没有进行这一调整，国内需求和就业率当然也会维持高位 — — 但进口和庞大的外部赤字也会不断上升。,"If the Greek government had not made such an adjustment, domestic demand and employment would certainly have remained higher – but so would imports and large external deficits.","If the Greek government had not made this adjustment at that time, the domestic demand and the unemployment rate would have been maintained at a high level — but the imports and the huge external deficit would have continued to rise."

如果任由目前的趋势继续下去，世界多数现存的生物物种将在本世纪末灭绝，而造成这种局面的虽然也有其他因素，但最主要的还是粮食产量。,"If current trends continue, the majority of the world’s remaining species will be extinct by the end of the century, and it is food production, above all other factors, that has driven the decline.","If the current trend continues, most of the existing species of living things will be extinct at the end of this century, and the main reason for this situation is food production."
自从 2008 年 9 月雷曼兄弟倒闭以来，欧盟和欧元势必受冲击的事实已经变得很清楚，因为欧洲缺乏统一的政府和财政政策。,"Ever since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, it has been clear that the global crisis would challenge the EU and the euro, because Europe lacks a common government and fiscal policy.","Since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, it has become clear that the European Union and the euro will be affected by the fact that Europe lacks a unified government and fiscal policy."

据詹姆斯·麦迪逊大学宗教研究教授艾伦·莱文诺维茨（Alan Levinovitz）看来，特朗普在推特中使用大写的次数堪与过去几百年中坑蒙拐骗普罗大众的“老军医”和神棍相比。,"According to Alan Levinovitz, a professor of religious studies at James Madison University, Trump uses capitalization in his tweets much as medical quacks and religious charlatans did in their efforts to bamboozle the public in centuries past.","According to James Madison University religious studies professor Alan Levinovitz, Donald Trump’s use of capital letters in his tweets is comparable to that of the “quack doctors” and “snake oil salesmen” of the past few hundred years."

第二，欧洲和美国看待彼此的方式之间存在一种持续的结构失衡：欧洲带着热情关注美国，而美国对欧洲兴趣一般，而且越来越不关心。,"Second, there is a continuing structural imbalance between the way Europe looks at America, i.e., with passion and concern, and the way America looks at Europe, i.e., with mild interest giving way to growing indifference.","2.
